Sentiment analysis on Amazon Reviews
====================================
Problem Statement:
-----------------
The flaws with the online available review are that people can freely post their own content, the quality of their opinions cannot be guaranteed. For example, instead of sharing topic-related opinions, online spammers post spam on forums. Some spams are meaningless, while others have irrelevant opinions also known as fake opinions. A ground truth is more like a tag of a certain opinion, indicating whether the opinion is positive, negative, or neutral.


Objective:
-------------
To find the accurate review and sentiment about the product and tag the opinion as positive, negative or neutral.
