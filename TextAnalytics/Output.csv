"1","This monitor is very sharp and clear as you would expect.  Unlike some of the reviewers with negative comments I was able to get it running at 4k resolution with 60hz.  My fundamental issue is not with those things like many others.  My issue is like one reviewer called a ""Milky white"" hue over the entire monitors image.  I've tried every combination of cables, Calibration on my 15 Retina Macbook pro (Summer 2014) and there is nothing that i can do to get this monitor to produce the color black or anything close to being acceptable as black.  For this reason I can't give it more than 2 stars even though in every other way (only after 2 days using it) it seems to be pretty darn good for the price.My next issue is that I spent an hour submitting and resubmitting my case to the Asus website... which did everything it could to make my entering of information difficult and  ensure I was human but didn't do nearly enough to actually accept and process my case. All I could get after doing this approximately 4 times with a ton of issues along the way, was an error after the submission with no other feedback.  I assume that because i never got an email from them saying the case was received that I had done this so many times for no reason at all.  And I refuse to sit on the phone for hours and hours getting little to no help like the other reviewers with issues did.  I'm extremely technical and did everything possible to save this monitor from needing to go back but not having the color black and living with everything looking like it has a white film over it is unacceptable for a 600 dollar piece of equipment, especially when the 170 dollar Samsung WUXGA monitor next to it has much better color while not being special enough to sit on the same desk.I really really wish I could fix this issue but this doesn't appear to be driver related etc.Just to frame it up I used DP 1.1 and 1.2 configurations (Monitor's menus), am using a 2014 MBP retina 15 (4k@ 30 and 60hz) and a 2013 MBP retina 13 (only runs at 2560x1600).  I went through the Mac display expert mode calibration process and managed to get the monitor to the best image i could manage.  After not looking at another monitor while using it this yielded semi-acceptable results.... except when you put up anything with black being a major part of the color palette.  This is where it all falls apart and i become Extremely disappointed and highly annoyed for every second i have to look at these 'dark grey blacks'.The image i have attached is the result of many hours of tweaking and calibrating.  The picture was in a poorly lit room so the monitor is getting more credit than it deserves but the one on the right is the Asus PB287Q and the one on the right is a 170/dollar 24 inch samsung with hardly any inputs of features (running at 1900x1200).  You can see that this 'best' image i could derive out of the Asus hardly passes for black when compared to the Cheap Samsung.",17,15,-2,32,46.875,53.125
"2","So after reading all the pros and cons that Amazon reviewers had to say about this monitor, I decided to jump ship and buy it.1 week using it and here is my review:EXTERNAL LOOKSA- Bezel frame: Thin (~1.5cm from all sides) and with matte finish. Compared to my ASUS VG278H whose frame is a bit thicker but full reflective plastic.B- Monitor stand: Made of matte plastic, now I am guilt-free for placing the center speaker right under the monitor on its stand not fearing to scratch it.C- Adjustment: As you probably know, you can adjust the height and tilt of the monitor (i don't care about the 90 degree rotation really), you must know this feature of height & tilt adjustment is crucial for TN type monitors to give you the best ""sweet spot"" to get best picture possible.D- Function Keys: Many pro reviewers said ASUS should move the keys to the bottom instead of the weird behind the monitor new location. I agree with that. But I don't agree with the pro reviewers that this caused them to press the on/off multiple times while trying to adjust the monitor specs, this never happened with me. Lets face it, pro youtube reviewers review like 100 things a week, they go on fast and clumsy when testing so yes it does happen with them, but when you are the final owner and you adjust the monitor to your liking, this should not happen with you.USING THIS 4K BEASTA- TN Panel: Compared to my other ASUS VG278H (using at home) and ASUS VE278Q (using at work), this 4K monitor has excellent viewing angels like them, if not a tiny slightly hard-to-see better than them.B- Colors: side by side as I'm writing this review, comparing this 4K with the VG278H, the 4K has more vivid & crispier colors, however the VG278H is more brighter and handles the contrast/brightness better. Is this really affecting my view? No. Any effect on gaming or regular photo viewing? No. If they weren't side by side, you won't notice. I tried to adjust both monitors to give the exact same colors but after 15 minutes I gave up, I managed to get them very close to each other, but when you see the same background on both monitors you can tell there is slight difference between the colors, but not something like WOW that's TOO much. Does it bother me? No.C- Regular computer use (mainly browsing the Internet): I completely agree with what people said that the fonts are TOO SMALL in the 4K to the extent that they are unreadable. I have excellent eye sight (knock on wood) and I sit like 2-3 feet from the monitor, I can't read, period. So if you already own a 1080p (or 1440) monitor, DO NOT THROW IT AWAY, use it as an extended desktop monitor and open all regular windows over there. I use the 4K for viewing videos, photos and watching youtube. I have set Google Chrome to zoom its pages at +%200 so i can also watch youtube at 4K resolution (yes, apparently some youtube videos stream at 4K, never knew that!) But the catch is the Chrome tabs are SO FREAKING SMALL to read their titles! I can live with that, at least the pages content are easy to read like a regular 1080 monitor. All other Windows windows (like control panel, folder browsing, My Computer, other programs like MS Office, etc...) area dragged to be used in the 1080p monitor, then when I watch a movie or run a game, the computer will automatically use the 4K since it is the PRIMARY monitor. Even when viewing photos, it will open the photo viewer in the 4K. Basically speaking everything will open in the 4K by default, you only drag what you want to the 1080p and next time you open it, it will open there immediately.D- Windows Scaling: I tried using the Windows scaling stuff (I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64x) but NO NO, because 1- You have lost lots of real estate space on the 4K monitor and 2- It will also scale on the 1080p which looked horrible. You can't tell Windows to scale on one monitor and forget the other. So if you have a secondary 1080 or 1440 monitor, don't use scaling and apply the techniques I described in point C above.E- 60Hz refresh rate: My 1080p ASUS VG278H is a 120Hz monitors, many people told me you will regret going back to 60Hz. I had a theory before that I posted in a reply at one of the reviewers here in Amazon about this monitor, that the extra huge number of pixels is going to compensate me with the drop of the refresh rate. Let me tell you and it's up to you to believe me or not, YES IT DID. One simple test i did was to open a folder window, drag it to be split between the two monitors so now half of it is in the 4K @ 60Hz and the other is in the 1080p @ 120Hz, i started dragging the folder window up and down, it was smoother on the 4K! Whether you believe me or not it's up to you, but I am completely satisfied. Theoretically speaking, the 4K is almost the same physical size as the 1080 monitor (28"" & 27"" respectively) but packs double the amount of pixels at each axis, so when you move something across the 4K monitor, it is relatively moving slower than the 1080p thus compensates for the difference in Hz between them. Everything in the 4K monitor moves smoother (but slower area coverage for same mouse movement) than the 1080p.F- Gaming general experience on two monitors: I won't waste time saying how games will look better on the 4K, YES THEY DO. When you game, Windows will use your 4K for the game, the other monitor will stay open on Windows desktop displaying whatever was being displayed, but your mouse pointer won't be able to go there anymore unless you exit the game. So if you are downloading a torrent or performing some activity, you can keep an ""eye"" on it while playing a game in the 4K monitor.G- 4K Gaming horse power required and the 60Hz/fps limitation: As I mentioned in point E, I have not seen any difference that makes me regret gaming on 60Hz, it is not affecting the gaming experience at all and I have tested on both screens one at a time, in fact, it looks way better to game in the 4K. As for the horse power, let me tell you, 4K is not a walk-in-the-park for your computer, I have 2x SLI EVGA 780Ti Superclocked ACX cards, the twin were able to maintain a steady 60fps performance with less than AAA games or AAA games that are 2-3 years old like (Call of Duty Black Ops II, Counter Strike GO, Sim City), but on high end graphics demanding AAA games like (Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed Black Flag) the fps averages around 45fps and i have seen it drop down to 15 when the screen gets too crowded for a second. By the way I'm talking here about full/ultra/super all-on in-game graphics settings. So to counter the low fps in these two games, I took an advice from one youtube review of this monitor which is to disable the AA in games because since you have higher PPI for the same surface area then AA is going to be smoother in games even if turned off, so I tried it and it wasn't that bad, this have increased my ""worst"" fps in those two games to 25 and the highest to 50fps. When any of those two games load first time, they stutter badly for the first minute or two while it is loading all the tiny graphic details like the vegetation and human faces, cars, ships (Assassin's Creed) all around your character, then the stuttering will be gone. So every time I run the game, I take my character for a 10 seconds walk around the city and drive one car till I see the stuttering has finished then enjoy a smooth game (until all hell breaks lose when 4 police cars are trying to ram my car that's when the game stutters a bit).FINAL THOUGHTSDo I regret spending $650 on this 4K? No. Games look superbly better, the 60Hz thing is NOT affecting gaming experience at all, period. But you MUST keep in mind you seriously need HUGE horsepower to play AAA games at full specs (minus the Anti Aliasing), otherwise if you have one 780Ti card or a lower 2-Way SLI GPUs, most likely you will need to lower game specification to get a playable game above 40-45fps. I ""assume"" if you have NVIDIA Titan it should be able to handle the 4K easily due to its 6Gb on board video memory, but that's a @2000+ card. Our personal photos are looking much better on the 4K, so sharp and beautiful and no longer we have to zoom in and out since almost each photo fits in the 4K frame without zooming, so you are viewing at original size on 4K, WOW. Even my wife who doesn't really care about gadgets and computers noticed that photos are much better on this 4K monitor. My only beef with this monitor that there is a tiny small grey-ish mouse-pointer-size (remember mouse pointer is twice as small in the 4K as it's in the 1080/1440) grey pixels that seem to be generating from way behind the monitor's front surface, as if it was a 3D effect, but since it is tucked at the bottom left corner (just above the Windows Start button) and when I game i never see it, I decided against sending the monitor back for replacement. I only see this tiny grey area when i have a plain white page like browsing the Internet.If you are thinking about this monitor, go get it, you won't regret it.EDIT 21/8/2014: Added more information, spelling and typo corrections and general formatting.EDIT 24/8/2014: I found a proper solution for tackling the very small font of the 4K when using the monitor for regular daily use (Above point #C in reviewing the monitor use). Due to the small fonts produced by the 4K, reading Chrome tabs and the URL bar was really too difficult to handle although i set the pages themselves to zoom %200 by default as mentioned above, however many windows were being opened in the 4K monitor since it was set as my primary monitor and I found my self more and more using the 1080 screen and wasting time dragging windows to it. So since I have changed all the resolution setup inside my games to play at 4K, I did a test and found that it really did NOT matter if the Windows 7 Desktop resolution was set to 1080p on the 4K monitor as the game will STILL launch at 4K res (3840 x 2160), so now my 4K screen is locked at 1080 res on Windows Desktop and I'm using it now properly, no more dragging windows so i can read! Another advantage now I can use those two-screens themed wallpapers which looks cool since the resolution match on both monitors! I have also put all icons on the 1080p monitor and kept the 4K desktop surface clean with only the taskbar in it! Hope this update helps.",44,50,6,94,53.1914893617021,46.8085106382979
"3","In reading these reviews, they range from ""OMG AWESOME!!!!"" to ""I've just sent back my 4th one..."".  I don't know the ratio of great ones vs ones people have to send back but mine is great.  Luckily for us, Amazon's return policy is great so if you get a lemon, it's not too big a deal to send it back and get a good one.  I know that's not something some should be having to do, but it's worth it to keep trying till you get a good one.Pros:-------- Very clear, crisp, detailed, sharp, vivid picture- I've tried low rez 120hz, I've tried triple screen, I'm back to this 2560x1440 at .233 dot pitch.  This is the  best to me.  For gaming, for reading text, it's all awesome.- After having tried 120hz and even triple screens at low 1080 rez (1920x1080 and 5760x1080), switching back to high rez, BF3 is amazingly clear and detailed again.  Not just the high rez, but the .233mm dot pitch is stunningly sharp to game on.  I'm convinced high rez is the best way to go.  Not 120hz, not triple screen.- The matte coating isn't aggressive or harsh- Stand does all the motions you'd want and is easy to put togetherCons:-------- Mine appears to be fine, no dead pixels, no backlight issues, no smudges behind the coating, so the panel itself is great, however the BACK portion of the plastic bezel that surrounds the screen appears to have nicks ands scratches on it.  Very minor quality control thing but it affects me none, affects the experience none.  Not too worried about it.UPDATE: 03/23/2013. Oh ;)  I just found out about this was, the Con that I was talking about.  It wasn't a bunch of scratches on the back part of the bezel.  It was actually a thin film of plastic that's supposed to be pealed off when I unboxed it.  My mistake.  The monitor is perfect.Note:  In the monitor settings.  Be sure to set some custom settings:- They say to put brightness to 37, however that was too dark for me.  I like 55- Contrast to 80- Splendid mode : User- Set your RGB gains to:  R to 47  G to 49  B to 45- Set Trace to 40Summary Update:  03/23/2013.  So been using the monitor for a few days and couldn't be happier.  No dead pixels, no backlight problems, stunning clarity.  Great monitor.  If you order this and happen to get one with a problem.  Don't get discouraged.  I know that sucks, but return it through Amazon and get another one again.  It will be worth it.  This is a great, detailed monitor with a vivid beautiful picture.  Played lots of BF3 as well and there's no ghosting/input lag issues at all.Another Update:  08/10/2013.  The moniter has been awesome except it began to have an electrical problem.  It started randomly cycling through it's graphic modes.  User, sRGB, Theater, Scenery, etc.  Rabidly cycling through modes and I couldn't do anything to stop it.  Menu buttons wouldn't respond so couldn't reset it. Left it unplugged for awhile but that didn't help.  I had it too long to return to Amazon, so I went through Asus's RMA process and that's why I wanted to give an update and give them props.....Asus paid for shipping to/from and replaced a board inside the monitor in about a week or less.  When they shipped it back, it was nicely packed well in packing bubble insulation and it works perfectly again.  Asus is a great brand, and their support is great as well.  This monitor is awesome.",20,43,23,63,68.2539682539683,31.7460317460317
"4","i am on my 3rd of these monitors, monitor roulette. 1st one, pretty bad bleeding, especially in the lower left. i returned it on amazon, got a new one, slightly worse on the replacement. what is odd, is if you very gently touch the lower left and upper right corners, the bleeding is reduced dramatically. almost like the screen isnt secured well enough. seems to be fine on the lower right and upper left, which makes no sense.anyways heres a pic, do see. it mostly is ok if you have a light on in your room, but trying to play a game with dark scenes or a movie, it is very noticeable, which is after adjusting the monitor settings (like brightness at 20/30 %) and enabling tracefree at around 60 which is supposed to be the ideal setting for this monitor.hope this helps someone buying this monitor, from the reviews i have read some people get no bleeding (but with standard ips glow), which others have some crazy bleeding like mine. guess it really is a lottery buying these kinds of monitors, which is a shame because it really is a nice one.",10,12,2,22,54.5454545454545,45.4545454545455
"5","This monitor is absolutely amazing for the price.  I was initially very disappointed because my mouse seemed to have a delay as it moved across the screen despite the fact that I have a very powerful computer.  This was because even if you're using a DisplayPort connection, the monitor is set to use DP v1.1 by default.  As you may know DP v1.1 only allows for a 30Hz refresh rate.  If you have a video card capable of utilizing DP v1.2 you will need to make sure the monitor is set to use DP v1.2 in order to utilize the full 60Hz refresh rate.  Once properly set everything feels extremely smooth and there is no delay.Monitor Settings:Menu -> System Setup -> DisplayPort Stream -> DP 1.2Computer Settings (Windows 8.1):Right Click on Desktop -> Screen Resolution -> Advanced Settings -> List All Modes -> ""3840 by 2160, True Color (32 bit), 60 Hertz""",2,9,7,11,81.8181818181818,18.1818181818182
"6","I'm posting this review particularly for someone who wants to know how this monitor compares to Apple's 27"" monitor or a 27"" iMac for editing photographs.So, first some qualification: I'm comparing my late 2009 iMac's monitor panel to this ASUS PB278Q. And, I'm making my comparison based on calibrating both of them using Coloreyes Display Pro calibration kit purchased within the last six months.My purpose for this monitor is to rotate it into portrait mode so that I can work on my vertical photographs in Photoshop, Lightroom, Capture One, etc, at the same display size that my 27"" iMac provides for horizontal photographs. (roughly 2/3 of my shots are vertical) So, it was important to me to get a close match in performance and behavior between them. And, happily, I feel I was able to do this.Leaving the ASUS in ""Standard"" view mode with no user adjustments and calibrating with the Coloreyes app and Spyder, I got a reasonable match, but noticed that the iMac color gradations were smoother, and not surprisingly, the ASUS looked a little sharper. I could have almost lived with this, but I decided to persevere.I won't bore you with how many approaches I took to resolving this difference, but my bottom line was that I got a decent comparison when I lowered the ASUS contrast down to 30 and then re-profiled it. Coloreyes' profile validation graph looked best at this setting and the monitors looked very close to each other -- close enough that I'm content to get back to work. ;-)This was actually a very good learning experience in that I got a better sense of what I would demand of a higher level (much more expensive) monitoring solution. But, there comes a point of diminishing returns and I'm going to settle for the performance that a 27"" iMac and this ASUS monitor provides for now.I haven't tried pairing two Apple 27"" displays, but I wonder if I tried pairing Apple's newer 27"" display with my 2009 iMac if I'd get any better matching. I wouldn't be surprised if I found a similar nuance of difference there as well.So, after calibration, with ASUS at Contrast: 30, three differences I see between the 2009 27"" iMac display and the ASUS PB278Q:(1) Slight difference in smoothness of very gradual color gradation in light and dark areas.(2) The iMac's blacks are blacker. But, when comparing actual photographs, this seems to be a non-issue.(3) Even after calibration, the two monitors do not display colors exactly the same. Here, the ASUS actually looks a little more ""right"" to me based on neutral grays and pure whites. The iMac looks just a tiny bit shifted to green. It IS going on 4 years old . . .Conclusions:Experience has taught me the value of calibrating your monitor. For someone who wants a good cost-effective solution, I recommend Coloreyes Display Pro. And, my conclusions are based on the assumption that you will calibrate your monitor.If you are trying to decide between Apple's $1000 display and this under-$600 alternative, you can safely save yourself $400-plus by going with this ASUS display. Use some of the $400 to get what you need to keep it in calibration and you'll be better off since you would need to calibrate the Apple display as well.If you are worried about pairing this display with your Apple 27"" display, I think you will likely be satisfied with how close you can get them. *OF COURSE* it won't be a *perfect* match. I'm not convinced that a new Apple would match perfectly either. At least in my case, it's a very workable pairing.My 27"" iMac does not have an anti-glare screen like the newer models. This ASUS does, and it's a welcome improvement.***I remember the first time I view my photographs on the iMac. I was previously using an EIZO ColorEdge CE210, which is a decent color calibrated monitor. The iMac just blew it away. And, once correctly calibrated, has served me very well. So, for me to say that I could be just as happy working with this ASUS as I have been with my iMac 27"" is saying something.Hope this is helpful to someone looking for this particular comparison like I was when trying to decide whether or not to buy the ASUS.If anything changes with use of the ASUS monitor, I will be sure to update my post.*** 12-11-2013 - OK, so here's an update. Everything is just fine with the ASUS monitor and I have very much enjoyed using it for Photoshop work. Today, I picked up an Apple ""Refurbished"" late-2012 design 27"" i7 iMac (barely any different from what they are selling today). So, now I can compare the look of the current 27"" iMac monitor to the ASUS instead of my almost 4-year-old one. Remarkably, the color balance is now much closer between the two. Just thought you might find that helpful. ***",4,37,33,41,90.2439024390244,9.75609756097561
"7","I went through 2 Dell U2713s before getting this monitor. The first 2 Dell U2713s from Amazon were awesome but had HORRIBLE backlight bleeding! It was quite unfortunate. I finally gave up on Dell and decided to order this ASUS monitor and it is just about perfect! Amazing panel, no dead pixels and virtually NO backlight bleeding :) I am a happy man who can edit photos with a smile on my face now :)",5,5,0,10,50,50
"8","I want to start by saying ""Pixels aren't everything!"". Also, I would give the monitor a 3.5 - its better than a 3 but not good enough for a 4.More pixels does NOT always translate to a better monitor or even a sharper image. That being said, this is a good monitor. Its not perfect - not by a long means. I would have considered a IPS PB278Q a perfect monitor IF that came in 4k at this price (maybe someday in the future).I currently own both the 287 4k and the 278 monitors. My new dual monitor setup actually has 1 of each and here's why.1) Colors are MUCH better on the 278. I have displayed the same picture on both the screens adjusted to the screen's native resolution. I currently have the monitors setup side by side and asked 3 random people for their opinion. The difference becomes even more apparent when looking at websites on both monitors.2) Text is sharper on the 287, though the 278 maintains a pretty good level of sharpness when compared to the 4k 287 monitor! The 287 is still better but not my a huge margin as I would have been expected. Its not day and night like when moving from 1080p to Apple's Retina Display. This is because of a couple reasons, but primarily because the contrast in colors between the background and the font is better on the IPS panel - since colors are truer.3) Sometimes, pixels are needed. More pixels allows you to put more 'things' on screen without having to zoom out of applications to reduce size.4) There is significant horizontal and vertical color washing on the PB287. I initially wanted to use the monitor in portrait mode but I cannot - the color shift is pretty bad. Its not so visible on whites and blacks but when you put up a uniform yellow screen there is quite a bit of color shift.5) There is slightly more eye strain when using the 287. I think this is because the way the monitor handles white - white looks much better on the 278. So hours of web surfing or Word/Excel use, would be easier with the 278.At the end of the day, I wouldn't be able to choose between the 278 vs 287. They are both very good monitors - it depends on your use. If pixels are everything, than go for the 287 - but, if you care for a vivid, strain free experience - the 278 is the better monitor. I have one of each and will keep it this way until I can get a 4k IPS panel.And, as for the Samsung 28inch 4k, I wouldn't consider it when being compared to the 287. The 287 is hands down a better monitor. Its better with color and with features (VESA support, tilt, etc).Hope this helps.I have both my monitors hooked up to a late 2013 MacBook Pro.Edit:After using both monitors for a couple weeks I find myself surfing websites and watching video on the 278 and using the 287 while coding (black background with colored text). Coder's would appreciate the pixels but for general use stick with an IPS display. I don't play games on my computer, so I can't attest to that use.",3,27,24,30,90,10
"9","Originally I purchased 2 x ASUS PB279's which are both 1440p, after getting a taste for resolutions >1080p I decided to go for the real deal (true 4K) and get two of these. I purchased one from Warehouse Deals 4 Less (who admittedly didn't do a great job with the packaging - they taped just the product box and mailed it across the country) and the other I picked up from Fry's (come on Amazon - at the time of writing you have no stock of these).The monitors themselves are great, an issue I've had in the past when purchasing two identical monitors is inconsistency. I once returned and reordered the same monitor 4 times because I could not get the two displays to have the same color calibration (one inevitably had a slightly colored tint to it). This was not the case here, these beautiful IPS displays have very accurate colors and look identical when placed side by side (see attached images). In addition, I didn't have to do any calibration - they're virtually plug and play.Pros:- Accurate colors- Good viewing angles- 4K looks very sharp- Stand rotates is height adjustable- Needed little if any calibration out of the box- Low profile designCons:- Not currently carried by Amazon- CostAdditional tip:- These come preset to Displayport 1.1 which maxes out at a 30hz refresh rate for 4k (3840 x 2160), you need to go into the display's menu and change the Displayport stream to use 1.2 - this will allow you to up your refresh rate to 60hz.Other:- The buttons on the display are in the back as opposed to the bottom (like the PB278Q), it took me a while to get used to - I'm not sure if they provide the best UX but hiding the buttons looks nice.- The ""grey to grey"" response time of this display is 5ms, ~4ms higher than a non-IPS display such as the PB287Q. Don't let this stat influence your decision, I don't know that humans discern a 4ms difference.",3,13,10,16,81.25,18.75
"10","Wow ... I just replaced 4 older 2K monitors (Dell 2408s) with two of these ASUS 4K monitors and I'm loving it.  Several years ago I indulged myself in what I thought was an extravagance of 4 monitors.  What I found was that my productivity and comfort was significantly enhanced.  I've been programming since 1975 so I'm a reasonably good judge of these things.  My Dell 2408s ran hot though, and since I've moved to a place which enjoys 115 degree summers it's become an increasing burden. I've been holding off until I could get a 4K monitor (I was originally planning on getting a single 40"").  Finally one of my Dells fizzled and popped and I had to either replace it or upgrade the whole kit.As I still don't see a good 60 hz 40"" monitor I thought that I'd chance getting two of these ASUS 28"" monitors.  They're wonderful.  They run cold, eliminating my heating problem.  They're light, so my wall mounts no longer sag.  And they installed on Windows 8.1 without a problem.  I'm running them in side by side portrait mode, with one of them inverted so that the control buttons are all easily accessible on the outer edges.  I can easily see 150 lines of code now which makes it much easier to read and I have the second monitor for my output and search logs.  I increased my text size to 150%, which helped readability, selected the Extra Large mouse size, and enabled the Control button mouse finder -- 4320 x 3840 is after all a lot of screen and it's easy to lose the mouse.It's only been a couple of days so I can't comment on longer term reliability but my initial impression is that these monitors are about as good as it gets.",7,15,8,22,68.1818181818182,31.8181818181818

"12","This is an ideal monitor for people who run both Windows and Mac.  I am a programmer so I bought a pair of these to have a lot of space for developing on either platform.  The setup could not have been easier.  I ran two Cable Matters Gold Plated Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt™ Port Compatible) to DisplayPort Cable in White 6 Feet connectors out of a MacBook and two BlueRigger DVI Male to DVI Male Digital Dual-Link Cable (10 Feet, Black) lines out of my PC and the displays are beautiful high resolution.For the Mac users... I use two Apple Thunderbolt Display MC914LL/B (NEWEST VERSION) at work and I prefer the ASUS monitors.  I can't see any difference in the quality of the display but the ASUS height adjustment is excellent compared to the fixed position for the Apple and Apple monitors are much more reflective so you have to deal with glare.

"13","I am a photographer and spent about 4 weeks researching monitors.  I went back and forth between the ASUS PB278Q and the Dell 2713H.  It was a hard decision but comparing the specs, the price point and reading other reviews I finally decided on the ASUS PB278Q.Here's Why:1.  The PLS panels produces better blacks than the IPS panels (which is very necessary for photo editing)2.  The price point at mid 500s saved me about 100 bucks that could be used towards a colormiter for calibration3.  There wasn't any real negative reviews about the monitor however I felt the ASUS didn't get the best reviews because it was a constant comparison to the better known name of Dell4.  The resolution was perfect and necessary for a 27"" monitor - 2560x14405.  It is 100%sRGB, which is the smaller gamut of colors compared to ProRGB and Adobe RGB however, sRGB is the internet standard and it still produce proper colored photographs.It is easy to get sucked into all the technical stuff and the numbers but what it comes down to is real world application.  Even with the most expensive, high end monitor with the wrong video card the monitor can be limited and vice versa with a great video card the specs of a mid-range monitor will exceed most people's expectation.  That is exactly what the ASUS did for me.  It exceeded my expectations on color delivery and accuracy straight out the box.  Coming from a 25"" 1080P color monitor where colors shifted depending on the angle of view the ASUS was like driving a BMW 750 vs A Toyota Camry.  It just did everything better.In fact I went back to old edited photos and corrected them because I had a more accurate perspective of color.  One of the most embarrassing things as a photographer is to have your photos shift color because your monitor showed you something different than expected on the web or in print.  I feel as if my editing skills have just gone up with the more accurate colors.You will read reviews that talks about light bleeding, flickering because of the LED back-lighting, etc.  I will tell you I have not noticed any of these issues.  Yes, on a total black screen in the corners you can see some light bleeding but in real world application it is not noticeable, not even one bit.  I noticed absolutely no flickering.  The monitor is a great monitor and I do not have any real complaints.  I am very happy with my purchase.Here are a list of my pros and cons (Please note my Cons are not really related to the ability of the monitor):Pros:*Color accuracy*Resolution (2560x1440 is phenomenal, it presents a much better presentation of images.  I can't go back to 1080p NOTE: for 2560x1440 resolution you must connect using DVI-D port or Display Port.  HDMI is not supported at this resolution unless your video card can support it.)*Size of monitor*Price Point*Wide Viewing Angle which eliminates color shifting depending on which angle you are looking from (No color shift from top/bottom or left/right)*PLS panels producing better blacks than IPS panels*100% sRGB color gamut*Easily rotated (must pull monitor out some to rotate to Horizontal position)*Ease of working in the dark or light*No reflections*The Semi-Glossy panel is not dull or patchy.  It's a nice mix of matte and glossy finish.*All connection cables are included in the box (Dual DVI, HDMI 1.4, Display Port, etc.)*Easy to assemble*3 Year warrantyCONS:*Doesn't come from manufacturer per-calibrated (but the price point makes it worth it and the colors are great out the box)*No USB ports on the monitor (a nicety but not a necessity)*Prefer side buttons instead of buttons at the bottom of the monitorAs you can see the pros out way the cons.  If you are in a delima of choosing a monitor and you want a great monitor without breaking the bank this is the monitor for you.  I believe you will be well pleased.  Other monitors of this size and resolution costs $100-$1000 more.  Jumping to a 30"" monitor more than double the cost versus a 27"" monitor but it is not a huge noticeable difference in size.  Also, for even better color accuracy you should calibrate the monitor with one of the better colormiters\calibration software on the market.I hope this review is helpful.Happy Shopping and again you will not go wrong with this monitor.",22,30,8,52,57.6923076923077,42.3076923076923
"14","First of all I wanted four things in a monitor:1.  IPS Screen.  23"" or 24""2.  HDMI,DVI,DisplayPort and VGA inputs.3.  USB inputs (at least two).4.  Sturdy Mount with Height,tilt and swivel adjustments.My budget was under $250 and, as I found out, that would be a challenge with all of the features I wanted.After looking at Dell, HP, Viewsonic and two other brands the ASUS was the only on that met all of the criteria.The PB238Q is a new model for ASUS.  It first shipped in August 2012 and there were very few reviews.  I went ahead a took a chance and couldn't be happier.PROS:1.  Beautiful colors and brilliance.  (I have an DEll XPS 8500 with an i7, 24 gigs of ram and a Sapphire HD-7970 graphics card so the system is fairly fast.)IPS screens really do make a difference.  I've had TN's and the difference is remarkable. True wide angle viewing.  You can stand almost behind the screen and the colors and images do not blur or ghost. No lost pixels or ghosting.2.  Every input I wanted.  I'm using HDMI but the DVI worked just as well.  The monitor has two speakers (albeit, not the highest quality) and with HDMI audio is enabled to the monitor.  I use my own speaker system but in a pinch the onboard monitor speakers are OK.3.  A four input USB hub on the monitor.  Two on the left side and two in the input section.  Great for plugging in your webcam, etc4.  Great mount.  Height, tilt and swivel adjustments.  Very sturdy.CONS:No major cons.  Two minor cons:1.  Onboard speakers are somewhat weak but what can you expect with a monitor.2.  Instructions are a challenge to read.  All of the info is there but they are on a large paper with about ten other languages.  Not a biggie.All in all for the price, I don't think you can get a better monitor.  Beautiful colors, very defined image, no ghosting or pixel loss. sturdy and adjustable mount and every input you could want.",9,13,4,22,59.0909090909091,40.9090909090909
"15","In 2015, 4K is all the rage. There are plenty of displays coming in at a similar price or even less than the PB278Q! Why would I choose this one?I am using this monitor for multiple purposes, and I'm guessing that you can relate to one of them.First off - I have this monitor connected to both a PC gaming rig and a Macbook Pro Retina, using both daily.// Graphics/coding/general use (Macbook Pro Retina connected via HDMI):- The screen real estate is great. Of course, a 4k monitor would be better, but 1440p is a great compromise between 4k and 1080p.- Colors look great. I don't need a perfectly calibrated monitor, but I wanted something better than a TN panel.I am using the sRGB preset, good enough for me! There are calibrated color profiles and monitor presets floating around the net, but having the brightness so low is painful.- The built-in speakers are boomy sounding when listening to music, but work darn good for watching videos.They don't distort, and get plenty loud! My only gripe is that volume can't be directly controlled through the OS (I think this is a HDMI issue).- OS X looks fine, no scaling for me.Even using a 'retina' display, the pixel density looks great (sitting 2.5ft away)-------------// Gaming/more general use (PC connected through DVI):So before this monitor, I have been using the Asus VG248QE 144hz monitor. It's 1080p, TN panel, meant for gaming.Games LOOK great. Seriously, the monitor is beautiful. When I hoped in to some CS:GO, it almost looked like I had SweetFX on! The washed out colors of the TN panel vs the rich colors of the PLS panel are no comparison.But do games FEEL great? Nope. Not if you've been spoiled by 144hz, 1ms glory. Will I get used to it? I don't know. I have the 144hz sitting in a box, tempted to set it up again for FPS games.This is not a gaming monitor. It is a great monitor, which can be used for gaming. My 780Ti holds 60fps in most games I've tried with my old settings.- Games look great as I explained above- 60hz is painful. Tried overclocking it > got to 90hz > tested for frame skipping > disgustingly bad > repeat -10hz > same results.- Windows looks fine, text isn't too tiny. Again, no scaling.------------I love this monitor, but it isn't without it's flaws.- This IS light bleed. I've attached a photo of it, but I assure you with 100% honesty that it is NOT noticeable and looks much worse in the photo.At first, I couldn't even tell if this was light bleed or not. Looks more like color shift from looking at a weird angle. It's fine. I was worried about it before I bought the monitor as well.- Menu is kinda weird. It' okay, but could be much better (steal LG's joystick, Asus).The only thing preventing me from 5 stars is the light bleed. It's not a big deal, but this is a decently priced monitor.Overall - great monitor. Enough real estate to spread out, not enough pixel to make your PC sweat and struggle while gaming.Sorry about the long review, but when I'm wanting a new gadget, I love read them!Oh also, to the person giving ONE STAR because the ""ports in the back are horribly designed and inaccessible"" -- I've used every input type on this monitor and fit every cable perfectly fine.",20,34,14,54,62.962962962963,37.037037037037
"16","I recently purchased a Mac Mini 2.6 GHz Quad-Core Intel core i7 and this 27” ASUS PB278Q WQHD LED-lit PLS Professional Graphics Monitor.  The monitor came with several connecting cables, VGA-VGA, DVI-DVI, HDMI-HDMI, DisplayPort to DisplayPort.  The Mac mini has an HDMI and a mini DislpayPort connection.  I tried the HDMI, but of course the best resolution I could get was 1080.  I needed an adapter cable to connect the Mac mini to the ASUS monitor.  I tried three adapter cables.  Neither the Accell B143B-003J UltraAV Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort 1.2 Cable, the StarTech M/M MDP2DPMM6 Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort Adapter Cable, nor the Monoprice 5106 Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter gave me the full 2560 X 1440 resolution of the monitor or fill the entire display of the monitor.  I didn’t originally purchase the Apple Mini MB571Z/A DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter based on its price.  I thought that the other adapter cables would work.  I went ahead and ordered the Apple adapter cable.  When it arrived, I connected it to the Mac mini and ASUS monitor.  When I powered the Mac and monitor back up, I immediately had full 2560 X1440 resolution and full screen display.  I have been using the monitor with the Mac mini and Apple adapter cable now for six weeks and have had no issues.  I have had no problems with the monitor waking from sleep mode like I have read in other reviews using other adapter cables to connect a Mac mini and ASUS monitor.  This is correct adapter for my Mac mini configuration and monitor.  I would not recommend trying to make the other adapter cables work.  This is a great monitor.  I love the resolution and color...and I haven't yet tried to calibrate it.  I wish the sound was a little more dynamic, but it's not bad.",3,9,6,12,75,25
"17","I love the look of this monitor. With my GTX 680 SLI set up it really looks fantastic. I've tried movies/games/office work and everything looks really good.

"18","I had this monitor out of the box and back into it, ready to be returned, in the span of about two hours. After setting it up, the backlight bleed in all four corners and across the entire bottom edge of the panel was so offensive it warped white into yellow and black into off-green. I understand that IPS and PLS panels are prone to edge bleeding and ""IPS glow"", especially in 27+ inch displays, but this specific instance far exceeds what can be considered acceptable. I'm willing to give this monitor another shot and have another one in the mail, but until then the 1-star review will stick.What's the point of a monitor with amazing color reproduction when the backlight completely devastates those colors on 1/3 of the screen? At least a TN panel's colors are uniformly washed-out and can be corrected with a good ICC profile - not even dropping the brightness to 0 could remove the bright spots on this travesty.",6,7,1,13,53.8461538461538,46.1538461538462
"19","Coming from dual 27"" 1080p Monitors, I will say this, once you go super narrow slim bezels, you'd never want to go back. This monitor is gorgeous and absolutely amazing in every way. Unless you are a competitive First-Person-Shooting gamer, otherwise this monitor is the best purchase I have ever made for casual gaming and professional use. 1080p vs 1440p, yea, you will see the difference but not as much as 4Ks. I would rather use one of these monitor than a triple setup of 27"" 1080p screens. Looking forward to the 4K version of this exact build style which is the PA328Q, the Perfect Monitor for non-hardcore gamers and professionals. This PB328Q is a VA panel while the PA328Q is the true IPS version at double of the cost unfortunately(currently sold on amazon.uk). I've researched plenty and compared most of the 32"" 1440p Monitors. This monitor came out late after the almost same spec version of BenQ BL3200PT, Samsung S32D850T, and Acer B326HUL. Take a look at this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASMKZDYVaVE video of those 3 in comparison. If you are in search of a Great 1440p monitor but do not want to spend so much to power 4Ks, get this monitor. You will not regret this purchase even though the price is a bit high. In my opinion, if this monitor was around $400-$500, it would be sold out within weeks or even days. Overall it is a very very good monitor 8.5/10. The PA328Q would be 9.5/10. Only wish these came with G-Sync or FreeSync with higher refresh rate other than 60hz. Meh, can't have it all.",1,9,8,10,90,10
"20","Not usually one to write reviews, but at the time of purchase a few days ago, information on this monitor was scarce.  So thought it might be helpful to folks to share a few observations.For comparison, my other displays are the Dell 2408WFP and BenQ 241W.  The monitor is generally used for professional PC work only, so no comment on HDMI, gaming lag, etc at present.So far, mostly just great news.  Love the relatively thin and simple bezel.  Not only is the minimal approach more professional looking, it also saves space around the monitor on the desk.- Packing was very good, no issues with the monitor.  Arrived double-boxed.  No dead pixels to my eye.- Out of the box, the monitor had some odd sharpness feature.  Why this is default on, who knows.  But it was easy to disable with the joystick menu selector.  Seems they call it ""VividPixel"".  Sharpness would have been a little more simpler term to figure out, but glad someone in Asus marketing is feeling better.  Set to ""0"" now, and looks normal.- Menus are easy to navigate.  Toned down the slight blue hue (to my eye) by setting the Blue Filter to level 1.  Set Gamma to 2.2, Brightness to 45.  Otherwise, pretty nice color out of the box.  Will calibrate with Spyder4 later.- Swivel up/down is smooth and solid.  Side to side rotate is good and firm.  A bonus would have been to allow the monitor to rotate 360 on the stand, but it stops about 1/3rd or so.  Might take the stand apart one day to tweak this.- No buzzing, no dead pixels, good accurate color and contrast thus far.  Really like the thin/minimal bezel compared to by 24"" BenQ and Dell.- The ports are USB3, easily side accessible.  I like how Dell places some USB ports underneath to minimize cord clutter, but the side connections will be fine for occasional use.- The built in speakers are acceptable, but not particularly loud (HP Elitebook is even louder volume).  Nice with Displayport to have the audio built in as an option though.  Most certainly not audiophile quality, but better than nothing.- Size-wise - very happy to have selected 32"" instead of 34"".  At 32"", my aging eyes are just able to survive with 2650x1440 resolution at ~3ft viewing distance, normal windows 7 font size.  Very comparable font size (equivalent?) to the 24"" monitors at 1920x1200, just more (lots more?) real-estate to multitask, edit documents, spreadsheets, etc.  The 34"" wider format would have resulted in smaller font sizes due to relative lack of vertical height. Very glad Asus and BenQ provided product offerings at this potentially more specialized resolution format from a working professional standpoint.  Games/Entertainment would be a different story, but for PC work, 32"" is great.Box mentions 3yr warranty which hopefully will not be needed.Update: 16 Oct 2015 -Monitor working great as the daily driver.  12h+ use per day, low heat use, no power saving no issues with Windows, screen still looks as good as day one. No buzzing or weird sounds. Luxury screen real-estate with apps.  A keeper for sure.  Yet to connect any gaming consoles, so no comment regarding ghosting or refresh.  But great for business apps!Bummed to hear about possible QC control issues.  Got lucky on this one it seems - must have been fortunate to avoid Monday or Friday mfg date.",16,34,18,50,68,32
"21","I had this monitor for about 2 weeks and it was pretty awesome.Then yesterday morning it didn't start up right away, and after 25 minutes of playing silly buggers with rebooting and cable swapping such, it came up with a 1 pixel green line about 4-5 inches (didn't measure it) from the right hand side.I tried to open a case through the ASUS online chat, but that required I open a case over the web. However their search box gave an ""Access Denied"" error.S0 I called in. Apparently their Tech Support line was overflowing, because I got someone who took my name and phone number and promised a return call within an hour.And I know you'll be SHOCKED to find out it didn't happen.So I tried their email support form, which refused to let me through on a perfectly ( see RFC 822 or google ""email plus addressing"" ) valid email address.This morning the monitor again failed to start immediately, so it's going back to Amazon (thanks guys) and I'll be buying from Not Asus for a few years.I realize with modern manufacturing that not everything is perfect, but if you can't properly size your technical support lines, either your assembly lines need to be fixed, or your product design.",6,11,5,17,64.7058823529412,35.2941176470588
"22","- - - - - - - - UPDATE - - - - - - - -I have been told by other users that this screen does not have a VA panel. Other users say it has (see: [...]). Perhaps Amazon is smooshing all the comments for different models of screens together and the user questions are for *all* models in this range. Very annoying if this is the case. So after using this monitor for a few days, I noticed a couple of problems. 1) It ran hot, 2) there was light bleed on the edges during the night using it in a darker mode. I still think this is a great WQHD screen for programmers for around the $300 mark, but I've finally settled on  the ASUS PB278Q 27"", which is an IPS panel without the corona on bright-dark edges that I got from the full-gamut screens: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009C3M7H0 - - - - - - - - OLD - POST - - - - - - - -After trying 5 different screens from Full-HD (1920x1080) through 4K (3840x2160), from TN panels, to VA panels, to IPS panels; I finally found what I think is the ideal screen for programmers! My requirements for a good programming monitor are, in order: 1) contrast, 2) light issues (glare, leak, bleed, milk, etc), 3) resolution, 4) color gamut, 5) refresh rate. Firstly contrast: a programmer needs good contrast ratios to get high quality readable text in a light room, and the same for ""night-mode"", where the lights are out and the screen is dimmed. Secondly light issues: I find that IPS panels leak light around the edges of high-contrast pixels, if you view a dark color next to a light color, you see a small rainbow where the pixels meet, which is incredibly frustrating while trying to program. I like to use sharp anti-aliased fonts when I program, so light-leak around high-contrast pixels is particularly noticeable. Light bleed on edges of IPS and low-quality TN panels are also very annoying. Thirdly, resolution: 4k is too high for comfortable reading of non-anti-aliased fonts around the 15px per font size, which is about the average size a font looks good non-antialiased (to me), typically I use Nerd Fonts, Sauce Code Pro Extra Light and ProggyCleanTTSZ (slashed zeros). I can see why 4K is possibly great to games, photo editing, CAD and the like, but for programming, I don't get why you would want a resolution that high, and I think that quality of the color and contrast options fall far behind the resolution with the current 4k technology. Fourthly, color gamut: I don't need 100% Adobe RGB or 100% sRGB  color space for 80% of what I work on, and frankly, a full color gamut screen makes most things fugly, because most things are not designed on 100% color space screens; however if you are editing photos of a sunset, or spending a lot of time getting screen color to match print, then yes, 100% Adobe color space is your friend; also the high gamut screens I tried, did not work with video due to refresh rate issues, the video played back without the full color gamut; which could be a real deal-braker if you're editing video. Fifthly, refresh rate: the higher the rate, the less eye fatigue; this monitor has 75hz, which is... OK but if the choice is that or having a 144hz refresh rate with poor contrast and light bleed around high-contrast pixels, then 75hz will do. Things that don't matter: viewing angle, because I'm sitting right in front of the screen; high color gamut, because I'm editing photos. All in all the ASUS PB277Q has the high-contrast VA panel which is crisp on fonts, the colors a great for the price. Bad point, the screen is too light, I have to weigh mine down with rocks to stop it from floating away.",20,22,2,42,52.3809523809524,47.6190476190476
"23","I have had 4 exchanges so far and they all had various distracting flaws like: dead pixels, severe backlight bleeding, poor uniformity that one side looked warmer, dust behind the AG, Dim backlight, and the 2nd replacement was completely defunct. The 4th and the last one was almost perfect (excellent uniformity, bright and minimum BLB), Almost! except one dead pixel on the lower left side of the screen, arrgg... But I've decided to just put up with it since another replacement might be worse with such p**s poor quality control. Honestly, I've never had any issues with Dell and HP IPS or Samsung screens, all were perfect out of the box and I have not replaced any of them.It is truly a shame, because the PB278Q is otherwise an excellent screen. First of all I don't notice the PWM even with brightness at 25. The Contrast and colors are deep. Colors are slightly more vivid than sRGB, but no where near as pronounced as on a Wide-Gamut panel, this makes movies and games look absolutely fantastic, especially after you calibrate it. motion blur is minimal, its pretty fast for a PLS/IPS panel but may not be the best for competitive fps. If you have a Nvidia card get the program Nvidia Inspector, limit your framerate to 58 or 59 to reduce mouse input lag if you use vsync, it helps a lot in fast games and it may also fix the micro-stuttering in games like Skyrim. The Anti-Glare coating is superb, that dirty and fuzzy look you see on many IPS AG coatings is not a concern here and you also won't see your reflection as on a glossy screen, its almost the best of both worlds.If it isn't for all the manufacturing issues I would totally give PB278Q 5 stars and I wouldn't mind paying $100 more if it means better QC. Still, this monitor will be my main screen for now, replacing my Dell U3011.",21,18,-3,39,46.1538461538462,53.8461538461538
"24","I had a dual monitor setup, but reconfigured my workspace; it only had room for one monitor.  I spent a lot of time researching various monitor brands and their specifications. My desktop is a Mac Mini, and although the Apple Thunderbolt 27"" display is the obvious choice, and I loved its 2560 x 1440 resolution, reviews and price steered me away. My search led me to the ASUS PB27Q and boy am I glad it did.This display is stunning. Gorgeous colors, very easy on the eyes--I can work all day in front of this at 2560 x 1440, no dead pixels, calibrated perfect (for me) right out of the box. Paired with the Cable Matters Gold Plated Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt™ Port Compatible) to DisplayPort Cable in White 6 Feet, plugged in the the Mac Mini's Thunderbolt (mini displayport) port, and I'm in high res heaven.Make sure you ""snap"" the displayport adapter into the monitor port.

"25","I researched for a couple of months before buying this monitor. It is a very good monitor for its price, it seems that it does not suffer from the backlight bleed issues that the PA238Q model, I don't have the PA so I can't confirm. But from what I read and seen in reviews and forums, this monitor has a much more uniform screen. It is a very new model so haven't seen any in-depth review on it in reputable sites like PRAD, but if you scavenge the internet you will find a site from China that did a pretty extensive review on it, confirming its Delta E less than 5 and 98% sRGB. Comparing the two monitors the specs seem pretty much the same. I would say that the only difference is the fact that the PA series comes calibrated from the factory and has probably more image fine tuning possibilities on the hardware itself. But I don't think that it matters much when calibration needs to be maintained and redone. What I did is I bought the PB238Q and from what I saved from the PA238Q bought a color calibrator.(UPDATE: Dec 3rd 2012) I Calibrated the monitor with Spyder4Pro and the analyses says its 98% sRGB , so as I suspected it is a very similar model to the PA238Q without the factory calibration and better uniform screen without the backlight bleed.",4,7,3,11,63.6363636363636,36.3636363636364
"26","This is one of several monitors that use an AU Optronics AMVA panel with excellent ~2000:1 contrast ratio. 92 pixels/inch means that you can see individual pixels (i.e. this is not a retina display). If you have excellent vision and a modern OS and mostly use new applications that deal properly with high-resolution displays, this may not be the display for you. For those of us with less-than-perfect vision, older OSes and applications that don't properly scale windows, graphics and fonts, this display gives a lot of usable (legible) real estate. It also uses only about 25W when set to a reasonable brightness level. Colors and viewing angles are excellent.So why only 2 stars? Because Asus's quality control for this monitor is abysmal. Out of 6 of these monitors that I tried, ALL had multiple dead pixels, and 1 was completely unusable with a garbled 1.5"" horizontal stripe across the bottom of the screen. The best monitor had ""only"" 2 dead pixels and I considered keeping that one. But ultimately I decided not to settle for a second-rate screen at the rather premium price of the PB328Q. Given that I don't know if the quality control problems stem from Asus or from AU Optronics I decided to order a refurbished BenQ BL3200PT directly from BenQ. Even if it was no better than the Asus, at least it cost significantly less. As it turned out the BL3200PT that BenQ sent me has a pixel-perfect screen. If I ordered 6 BL3200PTs, how many would have perfect screens? I don't know. But like every other monitor I've ever bought aside from the PB328Q, I don't need to run that experiment. Thank goodness!Bottom line: I highly recommend that if the PB328Q appeals to you, that you choose the BenQ BL3200PT instead. Amazon seems to stock them only sporadically. When Amazon has them, their price is about the same as this one.Some other choices that use the same 32"" AU Optronics AMVA panel:Acer B326HUL: uses strong overdrive that can't be turned off -> reverse ghostingSamsung S32D850T aka LS32D85KTSR/ZA: uses PWM at lower brightness levels -> flickerHP N9C43AA: PWM unknown?; large speakersHP G8Z02AA: appears discontinued, but still available; uses PWM dimming -> flicker; large speakersPhilips BDM3270QP: doesn't seem to be available in USAOC Q3277PQU: doesn't seem to be available in USQnix QX320QHD: ships from S Korea; brightness control changes digital white level instead of backlight -> much reduced contrast ratio, no power savings at lower brightness; no overdrive -> poor response timeAlthough this review is about the monitor, not Amazon, I'd be remiss if I didn't praise Amazon's excellent customer service throughout my ordeal with multiple PB328Qs. They cross-shipped replacement monitors to me, and covered return shipping for defective monitors. In fact Amazon has been so good to me that I feel somewhat guilty for causing them to lose money trying to sell me a PB328Q. I'm assuaging my guilt by posting this review to warn others away from this monitor, by suggesting to Amazon that they simply stop selling the PB328Q, and by continuing to buy (and not return) many other items from Amazon.",14,21,7,35,60,40
"27","The ASUS PB278Q, an amazing monitor in most aspects at a reasonable price.Since most people looking to buy a monitor with quick and useful info about I thought I should give out my personal experience of using it in the form of pros and cons.Pros:- Beautiful image reproduction (2560x1440p) with very rich colors wows most people that glance at it.- Amazing for gaming with 60fps at native resolution with very little motion blur. Also packs in overclocking capabilities to 85hz with ok color reproduction.- Multi input makes it amazing for media junkies and people that have many video devices.- PLS LES panel is flicker free, blacklight bleeding free and overrall amazingly good with 178 degree viewing angle.- Cable management is easy, and the vesa mount is able to fit whatever height, angle or orientation you wish your monitor to be in.Cons:- Thick vesel might be frustrating for people doing multimonitor gaming- Speakers are really bad, but it was expected as no one that cares about audio quality would use any built in speakers whatsoever- With displayport monitor takes couple of seconds to wake up from a sleeping PC- Menu is a little weird to navigate and the grid feature is very pixelated but nice to have none the less.While I am absolutely happy and in love with this monitor completely and its cons do not bother me much at all, I will never give a perfect rating to a product that is not perfect and I can see some people finding this cons frustrating. None the less, amazing product that is well worth the money.",10,22,12,32,68.75,31.25
"28","By far the best monitor I have ever purchased, so awesome I had to buy two of them. The screen has a matte finish so don't expect deep blacks or whites.. runs great at 4k.

"30","Unless you're a professional gamer, competing at the highest level, you really don't need a response time of 1ms on your gaming monitor. In other words, you really don't need a TN panel often found in BenQ monitors (not all their models but definitely their most popular). Don't get me wrong, BenQ makes phenomenal monitors, but if you're like me and the picture quality/color matters, I recommend purchasing an IPS monitor. This is a newer technology which provides better color and quality. The knock on IPS monitors is that getting a response time lower than 5ms is very difficult. Like I mentioned above, unless you're a professional gamer, it's very likely you wont even notice the difference. I do YouTube and pretty competitive gaming and I could not notice a difference between a 1ms BenQ and 6ms Acer playing a flinch reaction game (COD). Now, if we're talking about a 55"" flat screen TV compared to a 27"" monitor, you'll definitely notice the difference in the response time because the large TV will likely have a response time closer to 45ms. Believe me when I tell you, you will absolutely notice the difference between a quality IPS compared to a quality TN monitor, the TN panel's color will look washed out 10/10 times. Of course, resolution plays a factor here but when we're talking about console gaming (which I am), 1080p 60fps is the max you're going to get at the time of this review.Now that we have that out of the way, here's my review for the actual monitor. Let's be clear, this is a PREMIUM monitor. A few years ago when this monitor released, it cost about $700 (yes, this monitor is a few years old). $700 for a gaming monitor or second display is a lot of money, no question about it. Now that this monitor is a few years old and Asus has newer models (for much more money), this monitor is a steal at $400.Asus monitors, at least in my experience, are on the thicker side as far as physical dimensions. It's not because it's older technology as Asus still makes monitors that are thicker. That being said, this is a thicker monitor so keep that in mind before you purchase it. Not thick to the point its annoying or a deal breaker, but it isn't as thin as say, some Acer models that are on the market. And that's perhaps the end of the negative part of this review.I'm reviewing this monitor from a gaming AND second monitor perspective - I use this monitor for both. Let's talk about the most important part, the picture. This monitor looks GOOD. The picture is very clear and crisp, the colors pop and it's a really enjoyable visual experience. It's going to be a huge upgrade to just about all TN panels and entry level IPS monitors. I truly enjoy a nice picture and am willing to sacrifice a little response time, this monitor is well worth it, I promise you. If picture quality/color is important to you, then stop reading and add this monitor to your cart; you wont regret it. After all, that really is the most important part when it comes to a monitor provided you're not a professional gamer.The adjustable stand on this monitor received a lot of hate when I was reading reviews before I decided to purchase it. I have to say, I don't agree with the negative reviews about the stand. I find the adjustable stand to be quite convenient and work well. It has all the adjustments you'll need to get the screen in the perfect position for you. The base of the stand is kind of huge and I'm not sure it's completely necessary. But again, not really all that important.One of my favorite features of the monitor is the built in speaker. This is no lousy speaker, it is actually quite loud and pretty clear! When I'm tired of using my headset for FPS, I appreciate the fact it has a reliable speaker. This may not matter to many of you because you use external speakers, but for those that don't, or don't want to spend the extra money on external speakers, this is another win for you.Bottom line, this is a phenomenal monitor for gaming and as a second monitor for your PC/Mac. Spend the money on something you're going to spend a lot of time using, you'll really appreciate it in the end. By the way, 2K is a really nice touch as well when it comes to a nice picture.",15,39,24,54,72.2222222222222,27.7777777777778
"31","I this my second unit from Amazon.  The first one had a couple of imperfections (some type of speck or smudge underneath the panel).  After several days, decided RMA due to the distraction one of the imperfections caused.  Other than those issues, the monitor worked as advertised and had a terrific picture.  No noticeable backlight bleed (other than the standard IPS/PLS glow which is normal).  RMA was quick and painless and replacement arrived next day.  You can't ask for anything better.  This replacement is perfect.  No imperfections or dead pixels to be found.  No noticeable backlight bleed on this one either.  I highly recommend using the calibrated settings and ICC profile for this monitor found on the tftcentral.co.uk site.  Out of box settings are ok, but way too bright.  Some points of consideration if deciding between this and the Dell U2713HM:The ASUS uses PWM backlighting  (which can be a minus).  The Dell does notASUS: internal speakers  Dell: usb 3.0 hubASUS will do 1:1 pixel ratio for certain resolutions, the Dell does notASUS will do WQHD resolution from HDMI, the Dell will notAfter debating between the two.  Based on feedback from various forums, the Dell seems to have more issues with quality control.  (Flaky USB hub, image retention, blacklight bleed)  Of course each unit is different.  Check various forums and decide for yourself.  Personally for me this ASUS suited my needs better.One final note: Displayport may not wake-up after monitor goes to sleep.  Not sure if this affects NVIDIA folks, I am on an AMD Radeon.  Using DVI instead until I can try a new displayport cable.",12,8,-4,20,40,60
"32","This would be the perfect monitor in this price range if it weren't for a couple issues. My original purchase and several replacements all had 1 stuck colored pixel (bright dot as Asus calls them) Also each had quite a bit of backlight bleed. The one I am using now which has the least noticeable stuck pixel and the lowest amount of backlight bleed for whatever reason has a completely different color calibration than the first few I tried. Check out my pictures! Which looks better to you? The manufacturer date was one month older so it seems they changed something. For general use and gaming this monitor is awesome but there seems to be a lot of luck involved in getting an acceptable unit.",5,5,0,10,50,50
"33","Just received my new monitor and as mentioned in previous reviews, there is significant back light bleed (see pictures).One star might be harsh but I think it's unacceptable for a screen at this price point and maturity in development cycle to have these issues.UPDATE: Just received my replacement.

"34","These comments are after one month of use.....I may update this at a later date:First....very impressed with this monitor. I have an expensive ($500+ on sale) high end IPS monitor (Dell Ultrasharp) sitting a few feet away, and it's awesome, but not a whole lot better than this cheaper version E-IPS panel. Bought the Asus to run with a secondary machine so I wouldn't have to use my gaming rig when I need a desktop.Made a few adjustments with color being a bit strong out-of-the-box, and other minor tweaks, but that's about it. Beautiful screen with very good viewing angles. Monitor ships with stand attached, so nothing to put together. Stand is solid with every adjustment you could want, which is a luxury on the cheaper monitors.Had one or two stuck red pixels on the upper right hand corner of the screen, just barely on the edge. No huge deal but you always want a new monitor to be flawless. Turns out they fixed themselves (just disappeared) after it warmed up, not giving me the chance to try any of the various free fixes found online. (I probably wouldn't have returned it to Amazon anyway, given their location on screen... too minor of an issue).Also...this monitor has little, if any, back light bleed.I've used Asus motherboards and other products for years, which are excellent, but this is my first monitor from them. Noticed that they consistently get good reviews at other sites as well, so I'd been checking them out for a while.Since I wouldn't own a TN panel, this PB238Q is outstanding in all aspects at this price ($215.99 at the time)",2,18,16,20,90,10

"36","I was hesitant due to mixed reviews and reported issues with the panels used in this model and the other manufacturers' 32in 1440p monitors. Received the item - original packaging nested inside a HUGE box with plenty of packing materials to prevent jostling. No issues with display other than a very small blemish about 2-3 pixels big noticeable on a white screen. No dead pixels, and the blemish is hardly distinguishable from a speck of dust. I'm pretty finicky, so if I had bought this at a brick and mortar I would have exchanged/continued to exchange until I received a panel with absolutely no flaws. The very minor blemish was not enough for me to go through the hassle of repackaging and shipping back.The stand is super sturdy. The swivel function is a bit tight and requires one hand to hold the stand to prevent the base from turning with the screen. Maybe a surface with more friction would eliminate this issue. My desk is a natural wood ikea table top. My secondary monitor didn't have the range of motion of this ASUS and I probably wouldn't buy another monitor that wasn't as adjustable as this - unless it was VESA compatible and I planned on an aftermarket stand.Controls are easy to use after a little learning since they are not labeled on the front (I prefer the cleaner bezel look). Rather than hunting for the correct button I tend to use the ""joystick"" for adjusting settings, which I don't often do.I'm running DisplayPort for my PC and HDMI for my Xbox One. Another input would be nice for Chromecast.The screen is nice and bright and blacks are pretty deep. It's about as close to true black as I've seen in a screen that isn't OLED or plasma. Due to the size, colors may shift a tad in the corners when viewing the screen from 24 inches and closer. I've only noticed this with red images. It's very very minor. Viewing angles are acceptable.There's a bit of minor ghosting as expected due to the response time, but I'm able to play FPS games without issue. If you're used to a super low response time (1-2ms) it may be a bit annoying at first. I was used to the 2ms of my SyncMaster PX2370 so I had to adjust a bit. The trade-off of a lot more screen real-estate to view reference materials on one side of the screen while writing on the other as well as the utility of the screen size to serve as the ""TV"" in the guest bedroom/office is worth the slightly higher response time to me. It's worth having a decent gpu to run 1440p @75Hz. The difference between 60 and 75Hz is pretty noticeable. I wouldn't recommend running at 1080p if you're planning on using the monitor at the normal distance sitting at a desk. It is fine from a further distance (like a couch). I'm running a GTX 970 and I wouldn't recommend going any lower than that to run most things at 1440p @ 75Hz. I'm not the type to chase benchmarks. I had to turn down a few settings from Ultra on Witcher 3 and Battlefield 1 to maintain the resolution and refresh rate. The benefit of 1440p to me is that anti aliasing isn't quite as important at least to me. The higher resolution decreases noticeable aliasing.Good: Great stand, solid construction, good settings out of the box, no major issues with panel or construction. Nice image. Few options at this size, let alone at this price point.Bad: One minor blemish, not major enough to warrant a return. Only 1 HDMI input.Notes: 1440p @75Hz may push your current GPU if you haven't upgraded in a while and you plan on doing any gaming. The screen is large so desk real estate should be considered.",18,34,16,52,65.3846153846154,34.6153846153846
"37","Bought two of these and they are very good.  There is one issue I want everyone to be aware of.Asus has a newer version of the PB278Q, the PB278QR.  This is an upgraded panel of the PB278Q.  I recieved one of each, and the color is different as well as the on screen menu and buttons on the monitor itself.Amazon cannot determine if what they ship you is the new version or not, as both were packaged as PB278Q.  I'm attempting to get Asus to help, since it is very noticable the difference when you have two of the ""same"" monitor side-by-side.I just wanted consumers to know - the PB278QR is has a new improved panel by LG which you MIGHT get.  I'll update this when I get word from Asus if they are willing to replace the old version, as Amazon is supposively not able to guarantee they can send me the correct new version as a replacement.EDIT: The new version was actually manufactured June 2014 and the old version was manufactured July 2014.  I had previous assumed that the July 2014 was the newer monitor but that is not the case.  Not sure whats going on... but you definitely want the newer version if at all possible.

"38","The first one I purchased had severe backlight bleed, which was exchanged, no hassles. The second one arrived and it looks great. No bleed and no dead pixels. Much better.The overall construction is acceptable. The fit and finish is not near what you would expect for an Apple product but it's half the price. A small piece of plastic fell out of the vents when I unloaded the monitor from the box. Not very confidence inspiring for a first impression.The panel itself is nice, I'm very happy with the matte display. I've grown fond of the glossy Apple displays and wasn't sure if I'd like the anti glare, but I'm sold. Image quality and color was better than I expected.The stand is stable enough.The onboard speakers are a last resort. I'd much rather have an onboard USB3 hub than these crappy speakers.I've used this on a 2013 Macbook Air and also 2014 MPB, and had to purchase a mini displayport to displayport cable to hook it up.

"39","Well... within a month we started to have some connection issues. We should have run for the hills then and just replaced it, but it randomly worked so we thought maybe the cable was the problem. Within four months we never unplugged our laptop, knowing that it would take over an hour of poking and prodding and hoping that the monitor would connect again. Finally, it just stopped connecting at all. We bought a new cable, we tried different computers... nothing. The good news? We contacted Asus and we are under warranty. The bad news? We have to pay an enormous amount of money to ship this thing back, wait for them to assess it and then wait again for them to either send us a new one (which we know isn't going to happen) or get our lemon back in the mail... sometime.

"40","I replaced a 23"" 1080p 144hz monitor with this one. I tried to use the 1080p one for a few weeks as a second monitor thinking I would want to game on the 144hz but now the 1080p monitor sits unplugged on my desk. The benefits of 4k far outweigh the 144hz.When you first start using the monitor everything looks really small. Using windows 7 I had to adjust for the text size in the settings. Its easy to do. Everything looks so crisp and your eyes get used to it after a few days. With windows 7 there are are some little annoyances but you start to figure them out and after about a month of use, I don't even realize them anymore. I often.I find myself only using a small portion of the screen as the 28"" is huge! I can easily put 4 applications on the screen and be able to use them all very comfortably. It seems really large at first and just like everything else, you get used to it. 28 inches is a really nice size.Gaming is really good in 4k, 60hz in 4k seems very smooth. I play Battlefield and Insurgency and I really have a hard time catching frames, I have tried switching back and forth from the 144hz and the 4k and I swear the 4k looks better and feels better. When I put headphones in and play I notice a huge difference in heart rates and the feel just is way better on the 4k.Do note that I power this monitor with two GTX 970's running in SLI. If you plan on gaming at all, this is the minimum needed to get a comfortable 60 frames per second.Overall I am really glad I switched to this monitor and think it is a huge upgrade from the 1080p 144hz monitor I had. If you can't decide if you want to give up 144hz for 4k, just do it. It is well worth it",2,15,13,17,88.2352941176471,11.7647058823529
"41","This monitor is PHENOMENAL. The colors are fantastic and the quality is really clean and sharp. I was having issues with headaches on an LED Backlit monitor that was only 1080p, and ever since I switched to this one I've been much better.I'm a very avid photographer, and this has made a big step in the quality of my photos. I can see so much more detail now.Note to Macbook Pro, Apple Macbook, Apple users: In order to take advantage of the full resolution of the screen, you're going to need to order a Mini Displayport to Displayport cable; Mini-Displayport to anything else will not support the native resolution of the monitor, and you're unlikely to find this in any stores nowadays. You can buy a simple Startech or after-market one; I've done it and haven't had any issues. DO NOT waste you're money on the dual dvi adapter.

"42","The packing I received the monitor in was fine, but the monitor itself was terribly disappointing - there seems to be a complete lack of QA of any sort. The entire bottom edge has a dark shadow, the exact opposite of backlight bleed. There's one spot that's especially bad and very noticeable. Unfortunately, the service network in India is atrocious - the representatives visited and checked out the monitor, confirming it was a manufacturing defect and submitting the report, but refused to fix the problem - instead they asked me to send it back to Amazon.This would make sense if I was in the USA, but sending it back internationally is a almost as expensive as the monitor itself (Amazon isn't giving me a prepaid shipping option) and will put my credit card on the dock for both this monitor plus taxes and shipping, plus international return shipping, plus a new monitor plus taxes and shipping that I'll need to replace this, which I just can't afford.The panel feels okay otherwise, but it just doesn't come close in quality to the Dell panels I've seen, albeit the lower resolution ones.Not to mention that the price of the monitor dropped immediately after I bought it :-/ That's just adding insult to injury.",14,1,-13,15,6.66666666666667,93.3333333333333
"43","I bought this monitor because after weeks of looking and shopping around I finally decided on the Asus PA248Q. Now, I know what you're saying, this isn't that. True. Honestly, the reason I got the PB248Q is because the PA inexplicably jumped in price from 320 dollars to $450 in a five day span. After trying for days to find out the differences between the two I couldn't come up with anything solid that translated to $200 in my head, so I got it. From what I understand difference #1 comes in the form of a color test prior to shipping. I conducted a test myself and found my screen to be well within the acceptable range of color out of the box, and this is something you should do on occasion, so I'm not sure if that's worth the price difference. Difference #2 is an inch. I could honestly do without the speakers. They are tinny and muddled. They don't put out a lot, despite the sound system being called HD it really isn't. I would much rather Asus made a PC248Q that was $50 cheaper and had no speakers. Despite the speaker quality I am not removing any points for that because a. I never expect much from monitor speakers, and b. I couldn't care less about them. If you're buying a monitor and speakers are going to sway your opinion get whatever one you want because odds are you're not worried about the quality of your picture too much.The picture! Here's the fun part. It's gorgeous. 80 mil:1 contrast ratio at this price sweetens the deal a great bit.What I've used it for so far,Gaming (farcry 3 and Assassin's Creed 3)Watching movies in 1080pediting photosediting videosI ramped up the visual quality on the games to see if I could catch anything but this screen took it like a champ. Everything looked beautiful. Photo editing was great. My photos have never looked this gorgeous. I actually had to go back and re-edit some of my old stuff because of how good this monitor made my bad. Like I said, out of the box everything was spot on. The grid I thought I'd never use because what editing software doesn't have that feature? But it's so easy to just turn on with the click of a button on the monitor. So I will be using the feature a lot I imagine.The build: This monitor's base is a tank. The whole thing is really nice, and it feels like it could survive an A bomb. When I took it out of the box to set it up as I turned around I bumped into the corner of the monitor. IT GAVE ME A DEADARM! Seriously! I was amazed. The thing barely wobbled and took me out of commission for a minute or two, lol. Turning the monitor felt reliable and sturdy at any height. It made sharing my computer really easy. I love the ruler'ed edges. It's a nice touch. Turning the monitor 90 degrees was one smooth fluid motion. My one complaint about the build is the button placement. When I go to raise or lower the screen I tend to grab it from the sides. I also tend to hit the buttons on the side when I do this. Putting the buttons on the bottom or top of the monitor seems like a better option to me, but eventually, even the top becomes the side. I'm not thrilled with the navigation of the menu options, but that's more or less because I'm not used to them. So this can result in fumbling with the buttons until things go away. Especially in the dark.Addressing complaints on this monitor/Light Bleed: I see none. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about honestly. At it's brightest I saw no bleed.too bright: It was very easy to swap to theater mode, which greatly dampened the brightness. It was also very easy to just adjust the brightness settings. Out of the box it seemed bright, but my eyes adjusted quickly and it wasn't an issue for me.Packaging:The monitor came with anything you would want to use to connect except HDMI. It came set up on the stand well protected. I was worried because this is the first time I have bought a monitor online. But the foam it comes cased in is strong. A ups driver would've had to have a rough day to damage this thing. There was a film on the screen. Polish maybe? I used a soft cloth to wipe it off and it was fine.(the comp I used to base this review on is comprised of, Intel Core I7, EVGA 660, Gigabyte z77x motherboard)So, here's the bad part. The second or third day I had this monitor it made a high pitched squeal when it was turned on. It only happened after it was off for an extended period of time. If I turned the monitor on and off it would go away. But after the first time it happened almost every day. So I got a replacement from Amazon, and it did the same thing. I posted a question about it here, and followed the steps to see if it would work. None of them did. It wasn't my computer, it wasn't anything else in my apartment. From what I understand it was a capacitor loading up. A power supply issue. (Not my first Asus product with power supply issues). I contacted Asus customer service and they were a joke. The only two answers given me were send it in for repair (not happening with a brand new monitor thanks) or return it to Amazon. I contacted Amazon, told them what was going on, asked for a third replacement and they told me no. They then stopped carrying the product (although it is available thru other sellers it is no longer an Amazon certified purchase), and the informed me they would no longer carry the monitor until an investigation was done. Since another PB would likely be defective they opted not to replace it. I almost considered keeping it and dealing with the buzz but not at $250. I tried to post a video of the defect on Amazon but the file size was too big.So here I sit. It was an awesome monitor if Asus could get their act together and not cheap out on the power supply. I'm highly disappointed.",22,40,18,62,64.5161290322581,35.4838709677419

I got it for programming and gaming, and it gives me plenty of space to do so!**update**I initially stated that there wasn't any dead pixels but I recently spotted one in the middle of my screen after about a week and a half of use. I also noticed what looks like dust under the AG coating. I have a replacement on the way, hopefully this one doesn't have any defects. I wouldn't mind a dead pixel if the monitor wasn't so expensive.**update**So I have gone through 4 of these monitors, all of which have had pixel defects. I don't understand how others are getting panels without any defects... I must have horrible luck. Anyways, I ended up keeping one that has 2 almost unnoticeable dead pixels in the top left. It initially seemed perfect when I inspected it, but noticed them later during normal use. Amazon has been amazingly patient with me, and if I were to rate their service alone it would be a 5/4 stars, but this monitor has been a roller-coaster. I like having this resolution, and everything about this monitor is almost perfect except for the two dead pixels. Asus has really left me with mixed feelings at this point.",13,9,-4,22,40.9090909090909,59.0909090909091
"46","This monitor is the best bang for the buck for 4k gaming right now.  The first thing I did is upgrade skyrim to the 4k texture pack and set the monitor to Display Port 1.2.  Some people have complained that the buttons that are located on the lower backside of the monitor are difficult to use, while the buttons aren't super convenient, they are easy enough to use.I was unable to use my PC at 4k.  Things are just too small.  I ended up setting the resolution to 1080p for everyday use.  The monitor isn't nearly as sharp as it is at 4k.I would like to note that skyrim at 4k is fantastic.  I am using a Gigabyte R9 290 video card and skyrim was great at 4k.The annoying things are with the AMD drivers in windows 7 x 64. If the operating system shuts off the monitor, it would never wake up.  Hooking and unhooking the connection and turning the monitor on and off had no effect.  The only way to get the system to show video again is to reboot the computer.  Gigabyte email tech support for the video card was painfully slow.  They would reply to me once a day and ask a new question each time.  After about a week of this I found on my own that the monitor did not have the  correct monitor in the device manager.  It was a generic PnP monitor.  I upgraded that to the latest monitor drivers and the problem with waking up went away.  There is still some issue with the monitor going to sleep though.  Sometimes my system will blue screen when waking up the monitor.  Until the drivers catch up with this display, I would recommend setting the ""turn off my monitor after"" setting to Never and simply turn off the monitor when you step away from the computer.Even with the annoying driver problems, this monitor gets 5 stars.  It isn't perfect, but I am very satisfied.EDIT:  Latest video drivers fixed the monitor wake up problem.",11,15,4,26,57.6923076923077,42.3076923076923
"47","There are plenty of long reviews of this monitor, so I'll keep it fairly brief.  I am a semi-pro photographer (not my full time job) and I was looking for an upgrade for photo editing. Most importantly that the printer print what the monitor displays.  I got that right out of the box on this.  I did try to have it calibrated professionally using CalMAN and it had major problems.  The display looked fine but the pictures looked like a nuclear bomb went off.  it was terrible.  The key though is that the calibration made so few adjustments that  it is not noticed.My photos are SHARP, color is rich and not saturated, skin tones are excellent, and I confidently edit wedding photos with this monitor.  I would have to see a monitor that costs thousands before I comment on the actual difference, but there is NO WAY I would purchase one.Gaming...well, I did purchase the ASUS 144hz gaming monitor and thought I would use both: one for editing and one for gaming.  Not necessary.  This monitor does everything I need it to do and the image, the games look AMAZING.  The character detail is outstanding.This monitor is outstanding.  I will not be needing another until this one goes out on me which, hopefully, is years from today.I highly recommend as a photographer and occasional gamer.  I am occasional as far as time is concerned, but the games are very high end and look stunning.",4,11,7,15,73.3333333333333,26.6666666666667

I purchased it to replace a 1080p 22 inch panel and found it to be quite a nice upgrade.Pros:-Crisp clear lines.-Great vibrant colors.-Runs 75Hz as advertised.-No dead pixels.-Excellent stand.Cons:-Blacks are slightly grey if you don't adjust your gamma and color settings.Other:-I didn't have the backlight bleed that others mentioned.-For color I did calibrate the monitor and found it to be better than my old 1080p panel.-Shipped quickly and was packed in OEM box with no damage when received.-I am using the Display Port cable that came with the monitor.",3,5,2,8,62.5,37.5
"49","I'm not going to write out a ton on info on this monitor, aif you want a really long review for check out Toms hardwares 10 page review on this, its filled with tons of tests and comparisons and everything else you could want. I do want to say that if your looking for a 4k monitor that is affordable and has a nice image/features this is the best one to get. It's leagues better than the cheap china seike ones that have been out for a year now and a lot better than the compatible monitors from Samsung, Dell, Phillips, and others for a similar price. The image is absolutely fantastic its shocking when you see it first time. This monitor is perfect for averything other than PROFESSIONAL color grading, which you would want a $3000 model for. If you do editing but not a pro colorist this one should be fine for you, along with anything else you would want a 4k dislay for including gaming. The monitor runs at 60hz with displayport 1.2 so make sure tp use thay. The colors/contrast is great along with the viewing angles are great too!

"51","I purchased this monitor several months ago.  Last week, I received a new monitor the Samsung 28 inch 4K.  I am running both using the same graphic card GeForce GTX780.  I loved the ASUS monitor. Now with the addition of the Samsung 4K I realized to what extend the ASUS colors, sharpness, depth and vividness are far superior to the Samsung (regardless how much color adjustments I made on the Samsung).  Samsung offers more pixel however with almost identical screen sizes the extra pixels are not that relevant for every day use.  I now realize that for most PC applications, the ASUS 2560x1440 is more practical and has much better picture.  The 4K would only make sense for sizes over 32 inches to provide space for multiple applications.  Knowing what I know now, I would have preferred to purchase another ASUS instead of the Samsung 4K.",0,3,3,3,100,0
"52","I love this display!  I am a Linux user, and it just worked right out of the box, no special settings required.  In fact, I kept my current monitor hooked up, and it recognized both and set up dual monitor configuration.This panel is *perfect*.  No defects.  No dead pixels or other quality problems. Very effective packaging with double boxes and lots of foam.  I hooked it up using HDMI, and it immediately synced at 60Hz without my having to adjust a thing.Since this monitor is not 4K, there were no problems scaling.  Lots of screen real estate, so I bumped up the font size just a bit as I'm older, and my eyes are not as sharp as they once were.  I set my settings to force fonts to 120 DPI, and it worked extremely well, and made fonts much clearer and easier to read.  If you do a lot of reading as I do, it's a very good monitor for that, as it has special settings for color and brightness so that it's easy on the eyes, and it have five presets for adjusting blue light down so that it doesn't interfere with sleep.  The on screen display to configure the monitor is easy to use.It comes with cables to connect HDMI, Displayport or DVI, VGA, audio and for USB passthrough.I'm a programmer, and I play strategy games and watch videos.I can turn the monitor sideways, change the orientation to portrait, and read a *ton* of text, whether it's a book or code.Movies with a lot of dark or poorly lit scenes are amazing and show a lot more detail that my old monitor, a Samsung  22BW.  Contrast is greater than on any monitor I've seen.  It has a ""Darkroom"" mode that I didn't know about, that dims the screen perfectly for night use, and it's very easy to select in the OSD.Photo editing is a dream on this thing.  The large screen area means that I can load large photos and I don't have to scroll or adjust.  Colors are truly amazing.  I'm a photographer, and I'm thrilled with the color accuracy.  Photos that have fog actually *look* like fog instead of just washed out.The design is clean and simple and effective.  The stand holds the screen firmly but moving the screen takes only the lightest touch, and it's very configurable.  I like being able to lift it up so that I'm not hunched over, I can sit up straight.The viewing angle is quite good, and my family can all watch a movie together from different angles without color shift.I have ordered a faster graphics card to drive this unit, as I have a Geforce GT720, and while it works better than I expected, I have noticed that there is some stuttering on some games and on very detailed movies with action scenes.  It's subtle, but it's there.  The new Geforce GTX 970 should fix that.  I will update this review and report on the differences.  The new card will have Displayport, and I want to drive this monitor at 75Hz, as it requires Displayport 1.2 (the monitor comes with version 1.1 as default) and a high end graphics card.  The manual has a list of supported cards.One slight criticism is that this monitor did not come with a manual, but I did find that online on ASUS's website support link.I didn't take any points off because manuals are pretty easy to obtain online, but this would be a problem if the display didn't function properly, and while this was not a problem for me, as the setup was a breeze, if things went wrong for some reason, it would be difficult.  Not much of an issue for those upgrading from an older monitor, which is going to be the case for many.  Also, once manuals are printed and shipped, inevitably something requires a change to the manual, and most manuals are now found online.If you're looking for a 32 inch monitor, and you're not sure what to get, you deserve to give this monitor a look.  It's awesome.",16,33,17,49,67.3469387755102,32.6530612244898
"53","I was previously using 3 x ASUS VG278HE and replaced the middle screen with this one.I was expecting to be blown away and am not.All 3 monitors are in SRGB mode, and the colors are quite similar. This 32"" screen's resolution is marginally better that the 1920 x1080 @27"", but not that much crisper.I bought this screen as a ""transitional"" screen more out of frustration than necessity, waiting for Acer and Asus to get their act together on QC, especially on their IPS models.This screen is very uniform (as expected), and their is no light bleed (also as expected) (Since it's not an IPS or variant thereof.)I have all three screens on 125% scaling win 7, and all looks normal.I did notice the Titans in my Nvidia panel only offer 8 bit color? Not sure about 10 bit color. The color is a little better than on my TN panels, but nothing to write home about.I want to be blown away but cannot find any monitor in 2016 that has done so. I do not think 2560x1440 is enough for a 32"", I think I should have stuck to 27"". I will play Doom later on @75hz, and compare to 144hz, but am not expecting to get excited.On the other hand I am happy I have not bought an IPS with all the lottery attributed to these.UPDATE 10-19I have had this monitor for a few days now. I suppose I grateful because it is very uniform all over, but the colors are simply not as rich as I would expect them to be. It's quite sad, that the only thing I love about this monitor is that it is defect free.I also own a Sony XBR tv, and am spoiled by the deep colors the TV offers. I have no clue what panels Sony use on their high end Tv's but it makes this monitor color's look anemic and pale in comparison.Again, I think Tom's review is highly overrated.I have been studying monitors religiously for the past year, trying to find something which is problem free, offers great colors, and is also a class 1 or 2 for gaming. I cannot find anything.I have researched monitors for hours and days. No other product I have owned or wanted to buy has ever warranted this time-consuming research. IMO, a house for example is easier to buy than a monitor.UPDATE 10/24/2016I just purchased an ASUS VA32AQ to compare.This monitor (ASUS PB328Q) is much better. The ASUS VA32AQ should be avoided. Very cheap IPS panel, with terrible contrast and color.UPDATE 11/05/2015I have had this monitor for nearly one month now, and will give it a final rating of 5 stars. Blacks are so deep, oranges look way better on this  amva than on an IPS. Greens and reds look ever so slightly better on an IPS. Uniformity on this panel is great. Whites do look more white on an IPS.",13,15,2,28,53.5714285714286,46.4285714285714
"54","I purchased this monitor after reading the glowing Tom's Hardware review that made it sound like one of the best monitors you can buy for the money. I generally agree.VA vs IPS:One of the main things that drew me to this monitor was that it was a VA panel which gives superb contrast and much better viewing angles than TN (but not as good as IPS). I use a 27"" iMac at work and my roommate’s Asus PB278Q IPS/PLS screen. Compared to those IPS screens the color is not quite as vivid and bright, but still much better than any TN panel I have used. The reason I chose VA over IPS for this 32"" screen is to avoid the IPS glow. I play a lot of dark video games and while using the Asus PB278Q 27"" IPS screen I noticed some IPS glow around the edges. It was distracting enough that it pushed me over to VA to avoid it, ESPECIALLY on a 32"" screen where the larger angles would further increase glow. On the other hand my iMac IPS work screen is perfect in the bright office lighting. So if you use your screen in brightly lit areas I would recommend an IPS screen for the vivid colors. If you are looking for fantastic contrast and want to avoid IPS glow I would pick a VA screen.Responsiveness:I use my computer primarily for gaming so screen lag is something I worry about. I have heard stories of VA panels being slow. In short, this screen is very responsive. Moving from a TN pannel I noticed no increased screen lag. Part of the reason I picked this screen over the BenQ BL3200PT is that it has lower lag (tomshardware has the BenQ at 76 for absolute input lag vs the Asus at 41). This screen also runs at 75hz over display port which is a great addition.Color and settings:Overall the colors are very good and neutral. I never realized how off the whites on my older screens were until I compared it to the neutral white of this screen. As good as they are they didn't WOW me like the IPS screens I have used, but I think the contrast tradeoff is worth it. Overall they are still much better than any TN panels which I have used.On the topic of color I want to address the settings of the monitor. I made the adjustments that Tom's Hardware recommended BUT you should turn VividPixel off. It increases the contrast around the edges of shapes but in reality it gives everything a weird boarder.I would also like to point out that my screen has NO dead pixels and the backlighting is very uniform.The monitor is also very physically attractive and the stand is ROCK SOLID and very easy to move.Once you go 2650x1440 you'll never go back. I think that is the perfect resolution for a 32"".Overall for the money (I paid $575) this is hits all of the important considerations general use, movies, and gaming.",10,36,26,46,78.2608695652174,21.7391304347826
"55","This would be a good monitor for the price - if it worked. The first one I received broke after less than a week (totally dead, no backlight, nothing).  The second arrived with the dreaded ""spreading dead pixels"".  Also, the two monitors I received were not identical (the adjustment buttons and models appeared to be different) even though the boxes claimed they were the same model number. ASUS Quality Control is apparently nonexistent which is a shame because when it was working this was a great monitor. But given the quality control issues, I just don't know how long one that started out working would last. I returned both broken monitors for a refund.",7,4,-3,11,36.3636363636364,63.6363636363636
"56","I got this monitor and it was immediately having problems with the HDMI input. I sent it in on warranty and ASUS didn't fix anything. They sent it back saying that it was fixed and it hasn't been.

"57","I haven't had it long, but I calibrated it with a Spyder4Pro, and I can report that, with the full gray scale displayed, 242 and 255 are so distinct from one another that there is room for intermediate steps. At the same time. 12 and 0 are distinct but with no room left between 12 and black. On the test chart, cauc flesh is dead on and without off cast. Grays are neutral. Color patches look right, meaning that red is not the semi-magenta that so often appears. Spyder finds is good for sRGB. It is very sharp, showing true image detail.I would not expect, at this price, for it to match high-end graphics displays, but for what I want, which is to produce large photo images that will pass exacting stock agency reviewers, it is obviously going to do just fine. When I pull the test chart back to the common Dell 19"" monitor, the difference is shocking. I am VERY happy I'm not preping photo submissions on the Dell. (No slur on the Dell - it's not supposed to compete).I bought this one from Amazon Warehouse as an open-box with minor damage to the top of the monitor. I didn't see the damage while setting up, so it's of no consequence. All in all, it's a perfectly adequate monitor if you're not doing low tolerance color work indeed. So five stars for performance well up to expectations.I want to add this one note. You will note that the instructions with calibration sets, like Spyder and Colormunki, advise to let the monitor warm up for 30 minutes before calibration. I know that when this one wakes up, it has a distinct green cast, in terms of diachroic filter densities in old color film printing, I would call it ""5"" green. 30 minutes may be more than enough, but do not judge or calibrate your monitor until it warms up. In the time it has taken me to type this, it has pretty well but not entirely normalized.",5,15,10,20,75,25
"58","I had two 24"" monitors then found that I need more working space. Was kinda skeptical about large new monitors so tried to choose very carefully. Read a lot of reviews and got Asus 32"".

"59","This is indeed a professional grade graphics monitor.  I'm upgrading from dual NEC Multi-Sync P221W monitors, which have been great for years, to get a larger screen with higher resolution.  I was able to compare the same 16-bit TIFF image on the Asus PB278Q and the latest 27"" Apple Thunderbolt.  On paper, they have identical screen specs.  However, the Asus looks a bit sharper, in spite of the matte screen, slightly wider viewing angles and smoother color.  The Apple screen has deeper apparent blacks, thanks to the glossy screen.CalibrationFor calibration, I use the X-Rite Color Munki Photo.  After attaching the new Asus monitor, my system didn't recognize the Color Munki device.  Re-installing the Color Munki drivers fixed the issue.The monitor has several different screen mode under the ""Splendid"" menu. I used sRGB mode and the Color Munki advanced mode to set the color.  Side by side with the NEC monitor, color checkers look identical.ResolutionThe 2560x1440 image is stunning, especially compared to an HD monitor.PerformanceI'm using an NVIDIA Quadro 600 card with 1GB memory that is a couple of years old.  No complaints for video playback.  However, I noticed something odd - Photoshop processing is suddenly almost double the speed now.  I expected, if anything, the opposite now that the card has more screen to fill.  Maybe it has to do with the DisplayPort interface being faster.QualityThe monitor is well made, with a nice matte black finish.  The stand is sturdy, with no bounce or wiggle.  The monitor has a VESA mount, so it can be used on a studio stand.  My monitor has no visible IPS bleed and no dead or bright pixels.I'm primarily a beauty and fashion photographer, so the ability to work in portrait mode is a nice advantage not available in other budget graphics monitor.All in all, I'm happy with this monitor.",7,16,9,23,69.5652173913043,30.4347826086957
"60","I love the high resolution, beautiful colors, and clear text of Mac OS X Yosemite on my 27"" iMac at work. So for home I wanted a monitor that would get me as close as possible to the quality of the Apple iMac display with my modest Mac Mini. The easy path to high resolution would be an Apple Thunderbolt Display but I did not love its immodest sticker price. With a little research I found that the Asus PB278Q might give me the high resolution, color dynamics, and crisp fonts of an iMac/Thunderbolt for less than half of the cost.When I first plugged in my Asus to my Mac Mini using a Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter I got a shock... my Mac Mini didn't recognize the 2560 x 1440 resolution of the Asus. The highest the Mac Mini and the Asus could give me as an unimpressive 1920 x 1080. With a bit more research I found that the problem was my Mini DisplayPort adaptor. The Asus doesn't have s DisplayPort port. And the Mac Mini can't pump out 2560 x 1140 over an Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter.I needed to use a Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter--a pricy contraption with three connectors: DisplayPort, DVI, and USB. The USB connector is used to provide power to the Dual-Link adapter so that the Mac Mini can support 2560 x 1440. Awesome!Except that there was one snag... The Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter is huge. And the Asus has a lip across below all it's ports in the back that prevents the Dual-Link adapter from plugging into the monitor's DVI port. Even the cables that ship with the ASUS are hard to maneuver into their corresponding ports because of that darn lip. (Note to industrial designers: keep access to all ports clear! It's the back of the monitor so it does not have to look pretty.) Luckily I found that the DVI cable that ships with the Asus works with the Dual-Link adapter. My Asus monitor and Mac Mini are working perfectly together and I'm getting full the 2560 x 1140 resolution of the Apple Thunderbolt display without paying for it.Other things I like about the Asus PB278Q:- The stand allows you to raise the monitor up to eye-level, which really important for your neck!- The built in menu system is pretty easy to navigate with several ""Splendid"" display modes. sRGB mode works the best for me.- The on/off control is easy to reach and not hidden away.",5,21,16,26,80.7692307692308,19.2307692307692

"63","Incredible resolution on this monitor, but with major issues. Using with a MacBook Pro (late 2013) over a mini-Displayport to Displayport 1.2 cable.  The monitor loses the signal randomly, going blank, then recovering. When the MacBook resumes from sleep, the display may or may not turn back on. Using the power button doesn't get the signal back, the power cable must be yanked sometimes. Each time the display loses the signal and resumes, the windows in the computer desktop are resized and jumbled.This display has been a huge regret for me. No firmware upgrade has been released. I've contacted Asus customer service. They don't acknowledge the issue, which seems to be well documented here and on various forums. They tell me to check my computer, cables, ports, etc. Everything but their product. I would return it, but while I was wasting time with Asus customer support, my return window closed.Update:  An Asus rep contacted me a while back in the comments.  I just saw it and I'm following up.  I still have the same problems running the latest Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.  This monitor loses signal at least twice per day during regular work use.  My work on the desktop gets moved all over and I have to spend a minute or two each time reorganizing my desktop.

"64","Been using this monitor for almost a year and I LOVE it!  I wanted an Apple Cinema Display but couldn't afford $1k, so after much research I settled on this monitor.  I've previously used several Asus monitors for other projects and was happy with them, but this was going to be my daily driver at my desk so it had to be perfect.  I'm happy to report that after all these months I'm still completely thrilled with it.I had a few hiccups when I first got it, all dealing with trying to get my Macbook Pro Retina 13 to drive the monitor at its full native resolution (which, BTW, is the same as the Apple Cinema Display).  None of these issues had to do with the monitor but with the way the MBPr handles external displays.  The MBPr only supports 1080 output over HDMI so that's not an option, and its DVI output isn't dual link either so it can't drive this many pixels.  Your only option is to connect the Asus via Displayport using a mini Displayport to Displayport adapter.  I bought one from here on Amazon but can't find it anymore.  It was a few bucks, and well worth it.The viewing angles on this monitor are insane, as is the brightness and color rendering.  Once calibrated, colors were pretty much dead on and I can gather folks around it at my desk without anyone complaining about not being able to see.  It's every bit as good as the Cinema Displays that several of my coworkers have, and I could have bought two of them for what they paid for one of theirs!",4,11,7,15,73.3333333333333,26.6666666666667
"65","I do love it, but setting things up for 60Hz refresh requires a bit of help. I ordered this and the Nvidia GTX 980. As of writing this (Nov 22nd 2014) there is a major issue hitting a lot of people where the system will not cold boot if using a single monitor and the DisplayPort cable. Hangs after loading BIOS. This is NOT the monitor or supplied cable, it's the actual graphics driver. I have a dual monitor setup and I discovered that providing I use a DVI-I cable to the second monitor the bootup will take place on Monitor 2 and as soon as the Password page occurs it will swap over (auto) to the Main ASUS monitor.The monitor itself is crystal clear, excellent color reproduction and a near perfect viewing area. I do use the ColorMunky to ensure that color reproduction on the screen and printer match, but the monitor comes with a ""lot"" of choices for setting up you color preferences. Warning. First time in from a lower resolution monitor the icons that litter your screen will be really small, you can adjust the size easily.BUT the monitor come factory set using DisplayPort 1.1 (32 Hz only) and you must change this to 1.2 for 60Hz. You do that by opening the the on-screen menu >> System Setup >> DisplayPort Stream >> (select) 1.2.

"66","Love it.Was interested in either the BenQ or Asus.The Asus beats the BQ in almost every aspect, but without sacrificing gaming performance(no ghosting, up to 75Hz refresh).AND: flicker-free led back-light.Color is almost identical to ips based screens, but no edge bleeding, and nice/deep blacks,and ppl dont have an ""orange"" skin tone (ips).And the fact that its (almost) perfectly calibrated right out of the box, is a big plus.Everything i want to have ""different"" than stock (settings/button layout etc), can be customized.even the power led can be turned off.The only reason i would see, to upgrade? when there's a 40"" version available ;-)",2,6,4,8,75,25
"67","*great* new monitor. very useful for productivity work.make sure to get a good graphics card to drive the monitor if you plan to play modern video game titles: gtx 960 and up or radeon r9 290 and up.",0,4,4,4,100,0
"68","I do recommend this monitor if you are looking for a 4K one.  I think the higher price is worth it to get the IPS panel vs the cheaper TFT 4K panels.  Though not perfect, I gave this monitor five stars because it looks to be the best 4K IPS monitor available (for the price).///GOOD THINGS///-> THIN BEZELS – 0.5”-> MATTE BLACK PLASTIC - looks nice and doesn’t attract fingerprints-> GREAT STAND - can be raised/lowered, tilted forward/backward, swiveled, or even rotated vertically-> MATTE SCREEN FINISH - not as “vivid” as glossier screens but no glare is the better trade-off)-> IPS SCREEN – Helps the colors to look more uniform – makes a big difference on a monitor this big.-> FLICKER-FREE SCREEN – Asus advertises this monitor as ‘flicker-free’ – and I do get very little eyestrain using this monitor compared to others.-> 4K RESOLUTION – It’s great.  As others have said, you need to enable DisplayPort 1.2 in the menu to get 4K at 60 Hz.  I also got a much better picture after setting the ‘output dynamic range’ option in the nVidia control panel to full (it was at limited initially).  Regarding desktop scaling in Windows – 4K at 150% scaling is about like 1440p at 100% scaling.  Trying to use this monitor at 100% scaling is pretty difficult – everything’s really tiny but it’s nice to be able to fit so much on the screen at once.  I find that I like to use 125% scaling the best.  The 4K does make a big difference in games compared to 1440p – I especially like the higher resolution for strategy games.///BAD THINGS///-> SCREEN IMPERFECTIONS – a couple pixels are stuck red and a couple are dead – most of these have occurred months after buying which is worrisome – the good news is the pixels are so small it’s hard to notice.///NEUTRAL THINGS///-> BUILT-IN SPEAKERS – Can’t hurt to have them but pretty mediocre sounding.  Volume can be adjusted in the monitor’s menu.  Built-in speakers can be disabled in the menu as well.-> NO DVI PORTS – Doesn’t affect me but something to be aware of.-> IPS GLOW – The edges of the screen do look slightly brighter on a dark image – but the effect is no worse than it is on my MacBook’s “retina” screen.  I’ve found the IPS glow effect looks worse in pictures than it does in person.-> LOW BLUE LIGHT SETTING – Feature that makes the screen more yellowish to reduce eyestrain – it does help but isn’t something I use much.  It can be set at five different levels (including off).-> VIVID PIXEL SETTING – I prefer this set to the default of zero.  Turning it on makes text look artificially sharp like turning up the sharpness too high on a TV.-> TRACE FREE SETTING -> Does make a difference when it’s on – if it’s off I notice the cursor blur more.  I like the default setting of 40 best.///INPUTS///-> 4 HDMI – These are not HDMI 2.0 ports.  You can use all four of them at the same time in PBP mode.-> 3.5mm audio in – can be assigned to any input-> 3.5mm audio out – good for connecting computer speakers to or headphones.  Note that the quality is limited to 16 bit, 48 kHz.-> 1 DisplayPort (DP) and 1 mini-DisplayPort (mDP)UPDATE 2016-9-12I just wanted to say that after six months, this monitor began to have a problem with flickering so I RMA'd it through ASUS.  When I got the monitor back from them, there were dozens of stuck pixels and the screen flickered multiple times every second or so.  So I sent it back to ASUS for a second time, and they sent me a new monitor that had clusters of dead pixels on the screen, so I sent it back to ASUS a third time, and after two weeks they send me an email saying they have a part shortage and no estimate for the repair.  They offered to send me the cheaper TFT version of this monitor instead - I find myself doubting that they lack the capability to send me a replacement monitor matching the model I actually bought in the first place.  ASUS has very friendly and nice support when I'm on the phone (even though the wait was close to an hour when calling) or live chatting, but their service department seems to not have the slightest care whether the monitor they are sending back to you actually works.",24,37,13,61,60.655737704918,39.344262295082
"69","My eyes aren't what they used to be and when my new employer gave me a laptop with a 12.1 inch screen, my 23.9 inch 1920x1080 monitor just didn't cut it for full size drawings (I'm a consulting engineer), word documents at 100% I found bothersome to read (I can see the pixels at that resolution when close enough to read or when wearing glasses), and when set for 125% I cannot see the whole page on a 23.9 (24) inch monitor.After looking at 27 inch monitors with 1920x1080 resolution I realized the difference between them and 24 inchers was that the pixel size is increased and I would have an even more difficult time seeing at a working distance so my research led me to this Asus.  It's the same resolution as the Apple Thunderbolt with 2560x1440 resolution, $400 less (on Amazon) and has multiple inputs of various flavors. I decided to take advantage of the DisplayPort and the high resolution output of my laptop and haven't looked back.  I did have to adjust the display/text sizes in Windows for my taste, and I highly recommend using the ClearType setup for text.I can put up a full size drawing at full screen size and make out much more detail, many times I don't have to zoom in; word processing documents at 100% or 120% are easy on the eyes and there is so much more real estate on the screen that I don't feel a need for a second one (though I do use the laptop on occasion as the second monitor).  Word documents side by side at full size or larger look great, and at a proper seating distance of arm's length I cannot see the pixels.  I can sit in from of this monitor all day and not feel fatigued.I use the built in speakers with audio supplied via the DisplayPort cable and the sound is fine, not audiophile quality but decent, the speakers fire toward the rear; my monitor is 8 inches from a wall so it reflects the sound.I've done some CAD work and rendering; the lines and graphics are sooo much smoother, and photos, while not my main use for the monitor, look fantastic.  And if I had a better graphics card I can only imagine how even much better things would look.  The monitor has several other features I occasionally use such as the alignment grid and real-size ""quick-fit"" grids for A4, letter, and several other standard graphic sizes to help with real-size viewing of final work.All in all I am extremely pleased with this monitor and highly recommend it.",2,16,14,18,88.8888888888889,11.1111111111111
"70","I don't deal with graphics a whole lot, but I'm a researcher in the field of computational simulations/numerical analysis. My work involves long hours of coding while simultaneously referencing numerous published material. It's the type of work that very very rapidly consumes all available screen real-estate, which is why WQHD monitors are so beloved among all the people I work with. After using dual 23"" HD monitors for two years, I was fed up and replaced one of them with this monitor.The Asus PB278Q is one of the best WQHD monitors you can get right now (05/01/2013) for the money. I'll leave the commentary on colors and calibration to the graphics pros and touch upon some other aspects of this product in this review.** PROS **- Perfect amount of anti-glare coating. We have Dell 27"" WQHD monitors on our campus workstations and they anti-glare matte coating on their screens are very dominant. The colors appear washed out and you can never turn the contrast high enough. Not pleasant to work on. Asus gets it perfect.- A lot of people reported major quality-control issues (backlight bleed, dead pixels, etc) for the batch manufactured in Q4 of 2012. Asus must have gotten their act together because the monitor I received has absolutely zero PLS glow and I can't spot a single dead pixel. Color me impressed.- Asus includes every cable you could possibly need with this monitor. This is a huge plus. A lot of competing WQHD monitors don't come with this wide a selection.- Height, swivel and tilt adjustments are easy and smooth. There's no forcing. The weight of the monitor is balanced very well against a spring-loaded system. Adjusting monitor position is effortless. This is also where you get a feel for how good the build quality is on this monitor. Once again, very impressed.** CONS **- Hardly a nuisance but if you're a gamer, you will want to cap your frame rates to 60. Unlike smaller monitors, this Asus does not have a 120Hz refresh rate option and if you leave V-Sync disabled and uncap your fps, you might experience a little tearing or ghosting.- The built-in speakers leave a lot to be desired, but I don't hold this against Asus. This is a monitor. Not a sound system.** OVERALL **Buy it. Period. The comparably priced Dell and LG monitors aren't nearly as good as this product. The robust Asus warranty and the fantastic build quality make it worth your money to jump up one tier from the budget Korean WQHD monitors.",9,28,19,37,75.6756756756757,24.3243243243243
"71","I really wanted to like this monitor. It reviewed well, especially for gamers looking for a monitor with solid color and low/moderate lag. Yet, it seems like either QC is really off, I happened to get the ""one bad unit""*, or review sites are not being thorough.Pros:+ Very nice stand, with greater height than the Dell U2713HM+ Attractive, understated design+ All cables included+ Overall the build quality feels good (although the unit is a bit on the heavy side)+ My unit came double boxedCons:- Lack of factory color calibration means lots of fiddling to get a good image. Also, the monitor is delivered at 97% brightness (ouch, break out the sunglasses).- Backlight bleed was horrible for my unit. Maybe the LED module in the upper right slipped(?!). That quadrant was so much worse than the others...and the other quadrants were not much better.- PWM dimming is used (and at relatively low frequency, as reported in TFT Central's review). Sensitive users may notice flicker. I did not, but I did notice noise. The amount that the PWM circuitry produces was enough to give me a headache. Screenshot of audio analyzer is posted in Customer Images. Perhaps some units do not have this issue, or users are not hearing it due to environment or hearing sensitivity. Those with sensitive hearing and eyesight should evaluate the monitor in person.- Why does ASUS continue to use Styrofoam packaging? The Dell US2713HM came with all paper based packaging.*apparently, ASUS has ongoing issues fighting noise in circuit design lately, because two recent motherboards had similar noise issues on output (even with an outboard USB sound card with balanced speaker feeds).Compared to the Dell U2713HM...there is little comparison. Color and black levels are so much better on the Dell. Also, the Dell unit occasionally can be had for $100 cheaper. The ASUS unit should be priced lower, or QC should be improved.[EDITS] formatting, clarification, added detail, and adjusted tone from feedback",15,17,2,32,53.125,46.875
"72","I usually don't do this kind of thing. For about 2 months this monitor was good working at full resolution, but then I started getting flickering. I was connected to my Macbook pro retina 2012 via mini-display port to display port. I bought and tried different cables but got the same behavior. Eventually the display port just stopped working. I contacted Asus via support (It's still under warranty) they were cordial and arranged an RMA right away. After several days of waiting I got the monitor back in worse condition than what I sent in. There were scratches all over the place, the bezel was completely not installed correctly and worse of all the monitor no longer powered up. So I basically have a dead monitor sitting in a box in my office. After opening up a case number along with my RMA, and sending pictures and uploading pictures to different departments I have been 17 days (and counting) without a monitor not including the time it took to get it fixed the first time and not counting the time the monitor was not working correctly and trying different options to make it work. After being on the phone with support about this case I am being told now I have to wait 15 more days for Asus and FedEx (avoid them too like the plague) to figure if I deserve an RMA and investigate what happened. Meanwhile I will be over a month without a working monitor and no replacement in sight. I have requested to get a replacement and was told that I have no option for a replacement or refund; I simply have to wait with a broken monitor packaged away in my office that I can't use on any level. With this new timeline I am looking at 2 1/2 months of just dealing with Asus, RMAs and their shipping department and longer if you include the time to try to remedy the issue with different cables.  At this point it is safe to assume Asus has lost a customer; I thought they were better than this. I am pretty sure some people love this monitor but when this monitor and Asus is bad, it is REALLY bad.  When it works this is a decent monitor but when it doesn't and you have to deal with support, watch out. It will be a long hard road to get anything remedied.",12,17,5,29,58.6206896551724,41.3793103448276

"74","1800 reviews of this monitor. What can I add to the mix? I love this monitor, it is a delight to work with, to play with. I am more than pleased. My one caveat is to get a decent display port cable. Yes, this unit comes with a full range of cables. I used the included display port cable and everything was fine for the first 6 weeks, lovely display. Then, I started to have problems: I use two monitorrs, one is a samsung connected to the HDMI port. No problems with that unit, but I started having difficulty when restarting oe restoring with the ASUS monitor. The computer didn't ""see"" the ASUS monitor; I could play with it and finally get the computer to use it as the primary display. Finally, this weekend, no joy for my new ASUS monitor. The connection at the monitor was secure, I tried using another one of the three display ports on my EVGA 970SSC card. Again, no success. I called EVGA, they told me this was a fairly common occurence with the cheap cable that ASUS shipped with their pricey monitor. I was just a little disappointed, to say the least. I ordered another display port cable (for $18) and expect this will fix my issues. So take my advice and save yourself some trouble, upgrade the cable when you purchase this monitor. You can find a list of approved cables at displayport.org.",8,11,3,19,57.8947368421053,42.1052631578947
"75","The ASUS PB278Q is designed around the same plane-line switching (PLS) panel and screen technology as the Samsung SyncMaster S27A850T. It uses the same edge LED backlighting system and has the same tilt-swivel-rotate features on its height-adjustable stand.Connectors on the monitor’s lower back are restricted to audio- and video-only — there’s no USB hub here like on the Samsung. DisplayPort, dual-link DVI, and HDMI are your choices for digital video, while VGA is a backup if needed. The monitor has an analog 3.5mm line input and a 3.5mm headphone jack.The PB278Q has an integrated 2x3W stereo speaker that works when either HDMI, the line-in, or DisplayPort is used. The volume can be easily controlled using a direct-access button on the monitor’s lower bezel, although we found it easier to leave it at full power and adjust volume within Windows.Setting up the PB278Q is simple. Screw the base of the stand into the stem with a single thumbscrew, rotate the entire stand from portrait to landscape, plug in the power and display cables, and you’re ready to go.PROS:  - Great stand  - Great warranty from a well-known company. Warranty starts when the monitor was originally bought (if you buy used, or from a “Like New” Amazon Warehouse Deal).  - Less ghosting than the HP ZR2740w above due to newer technology and “overdrive” capabilities.CONS:  - Pricier, but not overly so like some of the $500+ 27” WQHD monitors available.  - Might be stuck around 60hz, uses PWM at 240hz, so may see some visible flicker at lower brightness levelsSummary:The ASUS PB278Q is a beautiful 1440p gaming monitor that suits the gamer who values image quality over response time and smoothness. I play RPG games and single-player adventure/action games such as Assassins Creed, Skyrim, and much more, where the surroundings and the color accuracy provides the most value to the gaming experience.However, the PB278Q will, of course, be able to play online shooting games like Counter-Strike for the average gamer but the more serious online shooting gamers would probably notice a lag as the response time, and refresh rate is slow compared to the TN panel based monitors.Nonetheless, the PB278Q looks good, performs great image quality and has a recommended resolution for gaming of any kind. Perfect for console gaming with its 60 Hz refresh rate, image quality and the two 3W speakers hidden instead of showing on the sides, or the audio line out on the monitor for your headphones.For now, I have it for two years already, and my next monitor will be 4k, but definitely from ASUS.",7,18,11,25,72,28

"78","UPDATE:Oh forgot to update. I got a new panel. This time it was double packaged (in Fedex box and then within that, the ASUS box). This one was definitely new. Keep in mind I ordered straight from Amazon both times.The second panel had, you guessed it, a dead pixel. I didn't mind it too much actually. The monitor OC'd to 75hz easily and the picture quality of movies were gorgeous because of the wider color gamut/saturation and the amazing contrast ratio. Honestly I really couldn't complain about the picture from my GTX 1070 through displayport.The reason I returned for good finally was that the input lag and ghosting is really bad. Asus claims 8 ms grey to grey, but even in game mode, I measured the lag in the high 20s, the ghosting didn't help either. I couldn't play anything too competitive. Also if hooked up my PS4 or PS3, and played a game or watched a movie, it didn't scale well. The picture was fullscreen but it looked really fuzzy and ""ghosty"" for lack of another word. I'm not sure if it was the VA panel or the anti -glare film they attach, but the picture again, looked ""ghosty"".Anyway I read numerous forums and all the amazon reviews. I didn't want to wait for the panel to develop new dead pixel and then Asus throw their nonsense 5 dead pixel limit needed requirement at me.My 2 cents, hoped it helped.Original Review:I just received this monitor and the first thing I did after reading all the complaints was to check for stuck pixels.  Lo and behold I found two instantly.  Then it dawned on me that the whole unboxing process felt a little weird.  All the cables seemed to have been in there, but there was no instruction booklet and nothing was neatly placed.To be honest, I think Asus is repacking units that were returned because they had stuck pixels and then telling the customer to shove off when they don't meet the ""3-5 stuck pixel policy.""I'm going to ask an RMA from Amazon.  Am not sure whether I should exchange it or return it flat-out.  Everything else about the monitor seems nice, mainly the 75h refresh rate and usb ports.",19,10,-9,29,34.4827586206897,65.5172413793103

"81","For those of you that have an Apple MacBook Pro and are looking for a large screen monitor to go along with it, you will need to be careful about choosing this monitor. The issues are not really with ASUS, they are more to do with limitations of earlier models of the MacBook Pro that I was not aware of until after I purchased this monitor.The first issue is that you need to have a minimum of the Late 2013 MacBook Pro in order to access the full spec of this monitor. The Late 2013, I believe, was the first MBP to come with Thunderbolt 2 ports. It also likely had a more robust GPU installed, both of which make a difference when you try running this monitor.I have an Mid 2012 MBP, the first Retina Display model. When I plugged the monitor into my MBP using a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable, I found that I could not select 60Hz at 3840X2160 native resolution, even though it was using DP1.2. When I tried the scaling options in Display System preferences, it showed that 3840x2160 was only available in ""low resolution"" This was also the case in 2560x1600. There was another lower resolution and also a 1080p resolution that could be selected under OS-X, which had a 60Hz cycle and did not specifically say ""low resolution."" At that point, why did you get a 4K monitor in the first place.Another issue was that OS-X gave you no way to scale text. So you needed a magnifying glass at the native resolution to read the screen fonts that you couldn't zoom. Also the text was not crisp, no matter which settings on the monitor you set. This likely has to do with the graphics card that comes with pre-Late 2013 MBPs than the monitor itself, though to be honest, the text for the monitors native on screen display was more than a bit jagged, so I am not 100% sure of how this monitor renders text.The thing that ended up being an absolute deal breaker was what using the monitor through the Thunderbolt port did to download speeds. The first generation Thunderbolt port, which there are two on the MBP is not capable of pushing all the data to the monitor and also maintain any throughput using ethernet connected to the other Thunderbolt port. While I didn't run benchmarking tests, I can give you an anecdote. I was updating apps in iTunes while the monitor was connected and turned on. I looked at the download times and it said it would take 15 to 20 hours to complete the download. I have 25Mbps internet, so that seemed ridiculous. I paused the download and restarted it. Still the same thing. Then I turned off and disconnected the monitor and restarted the computer and download times went back to 6 minutes. I then tried connecting the monitor again and the download times skyrocketed back to many hours. When I turned off the monitor and unplugged the Mini DisplayPort cable the download times dropped back down to 5 to 6 minutes. So I am pretty sure that Apple did not build enough bandwidth into the early versions of Thunderbolt to handle high speed ethernet and Ultra High Definition displays running at the same time.These problems really are not ASUS fault and it seems to have much more to do with earlier versions of the MBP not having the horsepower for this monitor. I wasn't too impressed with the picture quality and text rendering from what I saw, but this could very well be an issue with the GPU in the MBP and not the monitor itself. It didn't seem like you could get very dark blacks on this monitor, but I am not sure how much of that was the monitor or the monitor and Mid-2012 MBP combination.So in summary, do not buy this, or likely any UHD monitor if you don't have a newer model MBP. That may answer the question of why Apple left their Thunderbolt Display unupgraded for several years. It was likely that the majority of the computers that they had couldn't handle the bandwidth needed to fully utilize a large screen, higher resolution monitor.",10,10,0,20,50,50

"84","I have been using this monitor for several months now. I also own the Samsung 28 inch 4k monitor. They are mostly the same when it comes to picture quality, but the ASUS has a much better stand. I was not going to write a review on this monitor, but I have had a small issue with these new 4k monitors. Which I will explain at the end of this review.Pros:Great color for a TN panelDecent Viewing angles for a TN panelGreat pixel densityGood response times for gamesLarge size, if you are into that sort of thingBest stand and frame out of all the 28 inch 4k panelsCons:Buttons on the back of the panel make it difficult to make adjustmentsDifficult to run high end games, I use 2 780ti's in SLI to achieve decent frame ratesWindows scaling is not the best, but it is better than nothing at all..and now my biggest complaint. You cannot use a DP cable that is longer than about 3 feet. I was using a high quality 10 foot cable for a while and I would always getting flickering and an odd popping noise from the monitor. I had the same problem with a 6 foot cable. I learned that 4k at 60 hz pushes the limits of DP cables. I tried running the monitor at 50 hz, but it only made it slightly better. Once I switched to a 3 foot cable the problem went away. Hopefully the next generation of 4k monitors and GPU's will use HDMI 2.0 and this problem will go away. That or display port will get an upgrade. Its a minor issue that actually is quite annoying to me since I like longer cables that allow better placement. Other than that the monitor works great. Though, I am looking to upgrade to an IPS 4k since I miss the better color accuracy.",13,10,-3,23,43.4782608695652,56.5217391304348

"86","I have had this monitor for less than a month. Today I discovered that the button on the underside of the monitor that controls the brightness and provides navigation through the on screen menu is dead. It is simply unresponsive no matter what I try. It was working previously. This is supposed to be one of the best monitors that Asus makes and it is unacceptable that it would have this type of failure after less than four weeks of use.  Luckily Amazon's customer service is great and they are sending me a replacement. I will once again roll the dice and hope that I get a monitor that does not have defects. I was so happy that this one did not have dead pixels, but of course, something had to go wrong and a dead button was revealed to be the hidden flaw. I'm really looking forward to seeing what failure the replacement will have.  If you have purchased one of these monitors, you might want to check that all of the buttons are still working. They seem to fail suddenly and randomly. If you are thinking about purchasing one of these monitors, understand that buying an Asus product is a lot like walking through a minefield. You never know how things are going to turn out.UPDATE: Just received the replacement monitor. There is a dark gray spot right in the center of the screen which is very visible on lite colored backgrounds. Tried cleaning the screen but it appears to be under the surface. It's either a small clump of dead pixels or some dust behind the screen. I simply can't believe this! Back it goes for a refund. I will buy a monitor from a different manufacturer.",15,6,-9,21,28.5714285714286,71.4285714285714
"87","For the past 3 years I have been using a 27"" 1920x1080 Asus monitor for my PTC Creo CAD work.  I like the size of that monitor, but being that it's a TN panel I find it to be fatiguing after a long day.  My experience with IPS displays in several of my Chromebooks (HP Chromebook 11, Toshiba Chromebook 2, and a Pixel) made me realize how much easier it is to look at these IPS/PLS displays for extended periods of time.  When I saw that the price of this monitor had dropped to the mid $400's I snapped one up.  I connected this Asus to my Nvidia Quadro 5000 via Display Port, and it looks and works great for me.  For my CAD work everything looks great, and I find that I feel much better after a long day of looking at this screen that I had with my old monitor.  I was a bit concerned that the Creo text and icons would be too small, but things look really good (albeit smaller), and I actually like that I can have more icons and tree items visible without having to expand menus or scroll the tree.  I like all of the connectivity options, and the fact that all of the various cables were included.  I like having the ability to adjust the height, which I couldn't do with my old Asus.  And, the cheap built-in speakers actually sound okay (for system sounds).  I really like that the bezel around the screen is a matte finish, because the glossy bezel of my old monitor always showed the reflection of the lights in the ceiling (very annoying).  The non-glare coating (as opposed to a true matte screen) also works well.The only issue I have run into is a single stuck (on red) pixel.  I hoped it might un-stick itself after a couple of long days, but unfortunately, it hasn't.  I wouldn't fret too much about a single pixel if it were in one of the corners, but this one is near the center of the screen right in line with my left eye.  Even with it's tiny size, I am constantly aware of this pixel; especially with the light background of Creo's main window.  It has just been too distracting for me, so I decided to do a return and see what happens.  But, I still love this monitor and I'm hoping for the best with the new one.  It actually amazes me that you can have nearly 3.7 million pixels on a panel and only have 1 bad one, but it's also crazy how much that 1 tiny pixel can stand out when it's right in the middle of the screen.For my specific needs this is a great monitor, and I'm hoping to get many years of service from it.  If anyone has any ""Creo specific"" questions about this monitor, I'd be happy to answer as best I can.I'll be sure to update this review when I get the replacement monitor.I received my replacement monitor, and it also had a single goofy pixel in almost the same area as the original.  However, this one only shows up against a black background.  Since I never really work with a black background, I decided I'd keep it rather than continuing to mess around with doing exchanges.  Another thing I have noticed, now that I have been using my replacement for a few days, is that the fan on my first unit was seriously loud.  This new one is much quieter, and the monitor also seems to run cooler.  I even did a test where I cranked up the heat in my office, and while the fan was audible, it was not loud at all; even in a pretty hot environment.",16,27,11,43,62.7906976744186,37.2093023255814
"88","I've never seen a monitor looks so clear in picture and color. This thing is amazing. I placed the Asus PB278Q next to one of my other monitors and I could not believe the difference in clarity. Also my other monitor's screen had a yellowish tint compared to this monitor. My only problem with this monitor and I don't think it has anything to do with the monitor as much as with Windows 7. When trying to set the screen refresh rate to 60Hz it defaults back to 59Hz.. However it still functions great and I don't know exactly what the difference would be but it couldn't be that much. Maybe in response time. I don't know but I will say that the way I have it configured it works just great. So far I haven't had any problems with back light bleeding or flickering or anything of  the sort. It is a little pricey but I guess you get what you pay for.",5,7,2,12,58.3333333333333,41.6666666666667
"89","This monitor is amazing.  I have two GTX 670 video cards running in SLI mode.  I thought gaming might be a problem for this monitor.  It isn't. I optimized my games with GeForce Experience and the detail, color and stability is amazing.  I found that I like the sRGB  Mode.  It gives perfect color, contrast and brightness.World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, Assassin's Creed IV and Elder Scrolls V all run perfectly.  The 2560 X 1440 display is beautiful.Blue Ray, DVD and other movie formats come across with perfect color fidelity. You see the film as the Director meant you to see it.The stand is a definite plus.  It is perfect for professional CAD or Photo projects.  You can adjust the stand to reduce your fatigue.I was thinking of getting a 4k monitor but most of them come with TN displays and its tricky getting everything on a 4K screen to a size that you can read easily.  This PLS display has a Trace Free adjustment that prevents ghosting.  The color is perfect.  The whole screen is uniform intensity and color from any angle you would look at it from.  Angle has no effect on the picture quality. Its near perfect for a desktop environment.I would definitely recommend this monitor to a friend.",3,13,10,16,81.25,18.75
"90","This monitor is really bright right out of the box, but it is nothing that can't be fixed by turning down the brightness using the buttons on the monitor itself. Unfortunately, even at this price point, my monitor came with broken buttons. The brightness/up button was stuck for about 10 minutes until it finally died, and the menu button didn't work unless I pressed it and applied a small amount of pressure on a very specific part of the monitor.It's really disappointing and I'm going to have to return it. Which will probably be a process that I'm sure I'll enjoy, but I will have to wait until the holiday is over.",5,4,-1,9,44.4444444444444,55.5555555555556
"91","I'm a professional graphic artist, and I was on the hunt for a quality IPS monitor. The ASUS PB238Q has been fantastic so far - I haven't even had to calibrate it at all, just a minor brightness adjustment (was a little too bright for me). The screen offers a rich black, bright white, and excellent colors.The color/value shifting if viewed from sharp angles is very, very minimal.The stand is incredibly sturdy, and the height, swivel and tilt functions are very nice.The built-in speakers leave something to be desired, but I'm coming from an iMac, which had superior built-ins. However, I wasn't interested in the sound quality as much as I was interested in the display quality. You can always get better speakers, so this didn't really bother me that much.Overall a great monitor.",1,11,10,12,91.6666666666667,8.33333333333333
"92","I bought 2 of these monitors mainly because I wanted all my monitors that I have hooked up  to my iMac having the same 2560x1440 resolution.  This was super important to me.  I did lots of research on monitors and what to buy and which ones had 2560x1440 resolution. I found the Asus PB278Q 27 inch fit my requirements quite nicely so I ordered 2 of them.  What I love about them most is the resolution of course, but not only that, the monitor has so many options such as Portrait Mode (the monitor can flip sideways for spreadsheets). The height of the monitor is fully adjustable with quite a large range.  I have one of my monitors (the Middle one) sitting on a power supply switch box so it would normally be higher than the others but with this built in adjustment it worked out perfectly.  All the external monitors along with my 27 inch iMac are are the same level exactly. The flexibility of this monitor is just awesome. The colors and clarity  of the screen is super bright, and crisp. If I could rate it a 10 I would.  As far as external monitors to get, this is the one to own.  Sure its a bit expensive, but amazon does offer a considerable discount making it only cost me $469.99 per monitor instead of $700.00 each.  There are so many options on how to connect the monitor to your computer.  Since I have a iMac, it was a challenge for me to be able to hook up two monitors to my iMac.  I did it through the Thunderport input, using a optional 6 ft Cable ($9.99)  that I bought off amazon at same time I bought the monitor.I bought 2 of these cable to hook up from the monitors display port and the other end of the cable hooks up to my Thunderport ports in the back of my iMac.  I had the option of using either the DVI which i could have used I suppose but would have needed to buy a cable adapter for the TB port, so I felt the cable from amazon would work better in my case.  There were options as well to hook up via HDMI or Analog if one choose to use that, Personally I would not. This monitor does has speakers but I was not interested in the speakers as I have surround sound hooked up to my iMac already so I turned the sound option off on these monitors.  The speakers were not that great and I did not buy them for the sound but rather the picture quality and resolution.  It has easy to press physical buttons on the bottom of the monitor and the reason I like physical buttons is you know when you press them rather than the ones on other monitors that are touch sensitive and sometimes on those models you can't tell when you press them or not. You will know if you press these buttons on this monitor.All I can say is you will love the look and feel of this monitor.  You will definitely get your money's worth if you buy this monitor. Are there any Con's to this monitor?  Well if I had to nick-pick  it would have to be the speakers are not as good as the standard iMac's speakers but that does not apply to me since I have surround sound on my system, though iMac speakers sounds great.  These monitor speakers are not that great. If you have any questions on this monitor, please feel free to ask here on amazon.  This is 5 out of 5 Stars for me!",2,27,25,29,93.1034482758621,6.89655172413793
"93","The Asus PB278Q is Incredible, period. We also have a PB287Q, which is 4k 28"" (paid $650 in Aug 2014), but that one is just too small of a screen for regular use at 4k. This 27"" beauty has a better panel, is a more reasonable resolution for a 27"" screen, and is a better price point ($450 in Aug 2014). If you are doing detailed image work, get the PB287Q 28"" 4k monitor, otherwise, for almost any other reason, including gaming, get the PB278Q 27"" 2560x1440 monitor. The pixel density is adequate enough, it is more likely that your video card can handle a 2560x1440 resolution, and you won't strain your eyes to see content in programs that don't scale.The internal speakers are not great, not even good, but its nice to have the option to use them.  If you decide to use Picture In Picture, such as running a TV signal into the monitor, then you can output the sound from the TV signal through the monitor speakers, while your PC audio comes through your regular PC speakers.The buttons on the PB278Q (this monitor) are far easier to access and use then the PB287Q. On this monitor, they are on the bottom of the screen, on the PB287Q, they are on the back.Both monitors come with excellent stands, but to do a full rotation from portrait to landscape you have to remove the base... which is a pain, and you won't want to do it regularly.  Fortunately, the single thumb screw is easy to operate.No need to buy any cables, ours came with one of each kind (hdmi, dp, vga, dvi) in standard 6 foot lengths.Bezel is still a bit thick, but it is a matte finish, so no annoying reflection.The monitor stand base has a 360 degree rotation disc, that seems like it would make it very easy to rotate your monitor... but from our experience, just feels like a gimmick, doesn't help much, overall probably a moot point.",6,18,12,24,75,25
"94","This is a fantastic monitor. The resolution is NUTS, and the color is great. Nice input ports, very solid build quality, and it's obviously enormous.

I have ordered a replacement, and hope to have a blemish-free screen.Update: Amazon shipped me a replacement, but it has CLEARLY been used, returned, and repackaged. I don't want to be ""that guy"" who is crazy about perfection in products, but there are actual scratches on the screen and fingerprints all over the screen and body.

Unfortunately that quality didn't seem to have transfer to their monitors. After 1 year of use I'm replacing it. Why...It cuts out randomly for a couple seconds (screen just goes blank). It does this a couple times a day.When it goes into power savings mode it completely disconnects from my laptop so that I have to re-trigger detecting external monitors for it to come up.Plus it has 2 dead pixels.",3,3,0,6,50,50
"98","I really want to like this monitor. Colors are good, the resolution is great, etc. However, I am now processing my second return due to screen defects. Both my first and now second monitor have had either dead or stuck pixels on arrival (that did not heal by screen patterns, etc) in addition to huge backlight bleed in the lower right corner of the display (takes up almost 1/3 of the screen when black - but only on that corner).This has been an extremely disappointing process. Seriously, for the money spent and way the monitor is advertised as a ""professional"" monitor - I expect much better. This has really tarnished my brand loyalty and I have encouraged other graphic professionals I know to tell their friends to avoid this headache.",7,7,0,14,50,50
"99","I won't take you on the incredibly lengthy journey I went on by searching for a ""photo editor's monitor"" at a budget price. My absolute max budget was $300, but I really wanted to be closer to $200 if I could do it. While I would love to own a 16 bit monitor, I was well aware that wasn't going to happen at the $2000+ price tag. At the same token though, I needed something that was color and print accurate so I could edit with confidence that my prints would look like what I was viewing on my screen.This monitor is fantastic - the contrast and viewing angles are great and the accuracy is really quite amazing at this price range. I recently edited about 50 photos for print from a recent shoot I did, picked up the prints and then compared them with the on-screen images. In sRGB mode, I felt like the colors were spot-on and the final prints mirrored what I saw on my screen. The screen is a bit too bright, compared to the prints - but not bad. In other words, the screen can give the illusion of a well-exposed image (because it's too bright) when in fact, I need to bump the exposure on the photo another 1/3 to 1/2 stop. So for future edits, I know that what looks pretty bright on screen is actually a bit dim in print - and I need to increase the exposure a bit more. That's an easy fix - either through calibration or through manually adjusting the photos.I should also note that I'm 6'5"" and finding a monitor that adjusts well to my poster is hard - I often set books or get stands to elevate the monitor a bit. Not with this one! It has an incredible range of adjustments to practically an position you could want. All in all, I feel like this monitor was an absolute steal at this price! I can edit in confidence, knowing that the colors and contrast I see on screen mirror the printer's output... and for $200, that's not too shabby at all.If you're thinking about buying a monitor and want to keep it in the $200 range, stop thinking.

"100","Great monitor for gaming.  I got a great deal from Amazon Warehouse (have consistently had luck buying from them).  The monitor came well packaged, but with a generic displayport cable that didn't work to get 4K@60hz.  I suggest checking out displayport.org as there is a lot of great info there and recommended cables to use.  Even with having to buy a new cable i saved about $100 which is amazing for a 4k monitor.  Was hard to justify a $350 step up to the Asus ROG monitor, as much as that one is interesting and has a lot of cool features.  Once the price drops on those, may be interesting to compare.Back to the monitor - this will will be used 90% for gaming.  I have it paired up with a pair of 980s in SLI.  Everything is crisp and clear.  Colors seem to be very adjustable, but for me i just put it in game mode and left it there.  There is a setting that makes the blacks very washed out and gray, so avoid that.  I scaled windows up to 200% and that seems to have addressed the need for me to swap back and forth between lower resolutions.",1,15,14,16,93.75,6.25

The balance of size and resolution seem about right to me.One nice surprise, the monitor comes with *all* the cables. If it will plug into the monitor, you get a cable. They are about 6 feet long. That may or may not be ideal for every setup. It *is* nice to get the cables.The stand works fine. The monitors go into portrait mode with no big problems.

It reached the point where it would only recognize the HDMI signal after multiple resets.  All of the other inputs seemed to work correctly.  (Tested with multiple computers and multiple cables.)I contacted Asus support and spent 15 minutes going through the usual scripted questions.  At the end of that the HD technician said that I should send the monitor in and they'd send out a replacement.  Since I didn't have the original box to ship it in, I pointed out that this monitor includes their  ""VIP"" support which includes advance shipment.  The tech stated that that only applies if they have one available (not what it says in the docs) and that he would check on it.  He put me on ""hold"" - which is to say he terminated my call.I called back and got a different tech.  Went through the same process, got the same disclaimer.  This time he put me on hold to check and see if there was a monitor available for advance replacement.  10 minutes later he came back and said that there was not a monitor available.I asked to speak to a supervisor.  About 15 minutes later he came back and said that there was still no supervisor available but that they had found a monitor to ship me.  After I provided my info again, he arranged shipment (though they put a hold on my credit card equal to the retail price of the monitor).The monitor showed up promptly with return shipping (prepaid) provided.

To be honest, they're mostly stationary on my desk (they're on arms so I can move them but usually I don't). I'm always viewing them from the same angle, so I don't notice at all. They look fantastic.I'm running Fedora 22 and with the included cables they were detected out of the box and running at 3840x2160 @ 60 Hz.Very fast response time (benefit of TN). I was considering a couple of the Samsung TN displays as well but this one was less expensive and had a VESA mount while the Samsung models didn't. That was a deal breaker for me with the Samsung's. I'm glad I went with this monitor.These were an upgrade for me from three 28"" 1920x1200 displays. I'm amazed, I love 4k. I'm not scaling it at all and even though I don't have the best vision I can read almost everything. It took me a few hours to get used to it, but now I can read almost everything without increasing any DPI settings.I'm also not an artist, so most colors look the same to me anyways, but it seems like they do a great job of representing colors. I'm very happy with them, and I think most users who aren't professional art designers would be as well.I'm an engineer and I do CAD work and programming primarily with these.

However ASUS doesn't seem to QC these panels very well. All of the displays which I have received, four as of writing this, two originally, have had some sort of defect. One of the first I ordered featured some dust and dirt with a bit of hair in between the panes. The replacement then had a grouping of dead pixels in the center of the display. And then the replacement for that also has a group of dead pixels in the center of the display.TL;DR I would steer clear of these displays till there is some improvement in the QC, especially for a display in this price range.",5,7,2,12,58.3333333333333,41.6666666666667
"112","I got this monitor because I was looking for a good value at this resolution level. Overall I would say it is a solid offering for the price. But there are a few things I am surprised to see in a nearly $400 purchase.When this item arrived, it was obvious that it was not new. On the unit there was a 2-3mm separation between the plastic of the front trim and the back of the unit, when every other corner of the monitor was sealed as expected with no gaps. To me it looked like the unit was dropped before. I was concerned this would lead to a backlight bleeding issue but haven't seen much bleeding so far.The HDMI cables in the box were indeed wrapped in plastic, but when I opened them, there were some dirty fingerprints on the metal parts of the connections. There were also fingerprints, smudges, and scratches on the back and front of the unit itself, even some scratches on the ASUS logo on the front. I could have bought this same item refurbished and saved $50, but I chose not to, since I heard about refurbished items having issues like this. But the item I got looked used anyway.",9,5,-4,14,35.7142857142857,64.2857142857143
"113","This is an excellent and somewhat unique display, and it perfectly suits my needs, at least until OLED displays are common and affordable.My requirements for a display, in order:-- Not IPS (IPS glow reduces perceived contrast, and seems inherent to that panel type)-- Not TN (inherently poor contrast, generally less color depth, and bad off axis view)-- 2K 1440p resolution, not 4K (to avoid GPU upgrade from my 970)-- less than 100 ppi, as Windows scaling is atrociousCons:-- 2 dead pixels (99.9999457% of pixels work)-- Some minimal ghosting in darker scenes of games and movies, but only the keen-eyed 144Hz users will notice.Contrast is king; literally the single most important factor when it comes to image quality, not just in displays but in all imaging technology. Camera lenses are valued for the contrast of the photos they produce, and I have never once wanted to see LESS range between the lightest and darkest parts of a scene. Do yourself a favor and always demand the greatest (static) contrast ratio possible.Also, if you play games, get this version of the AU Optronics 32"" AMVA panel, as it is the only one that runs at 75Hz, unless the risk of a couple of dead pixels (or more and having to RMA) really are a deal breaker for you. If so, buy the BenQ and trade less pixel response and less contrast for those 2 pixels so you can claim that you have a ""pixel perfect"" display.",8,8,0,16,50,50
"114","My first one star review sadly. This is why I'm writing this:Bought one first from Amazon Warehouse, refurbished. When it arrived it had a stuck blue line from top to bottom. Amazon kindly refunded my money. Decided to buy a new one instead. That one has been working fine for close to a year now.To keep things looking the same. I ordered another one bit more than a month ago. It arrived, checked, everything great. First the monitor started turning off for less than a second randomly. Now it is also making a weird popping sound when it goes black. I don't know if it is serious or not. But it is causing me a lot of stress thinking than it will die soon. It's barely new and I don't have the box anymore. Even if I had it, I would have to deal with Asus directly and since I don't live in the states shipping this thing is REALLY expensive.I'm just writing this so people know that there is something wrong with the quality of Asus monitors in general. A friend of mine has my exact monitor and in his case the DP port stopped working. Also 2 other friends bought different versions and for 1 the monitor came with a lot of stuck pixels, had to return it to amazon and bought a new one with no problems for now. Other friend of mine got 2 of the gaming versions and for one of the monitors the speakers stopped working.I wanted to trust Asus but I can't afford it.",9,7,-2,16,43.75,56.25

"117","I wanted to pick up a decent, inexpensive 4k screen for my son's computer.  He's been fiddling with mods and textures on some games with a mid range video card (r9 270x) and a planar 1080p monitor.  Its his art.  But the video card and 1080p were holding him back...not enough vram, not enough pixels.I picked up an overclocked 970 which is a wonderful card.  We haven't tried it out on the very latest super high res games but he's running the batman series (including arkham knight), skyrim, etc.  Arkham Knight chokes a little at the higher resolutions with everything turned on but he's still getting ~35-50fps most of the time.  But AK is glitchy and slow on the PC, hopefully they'll fix that this fall.After looking at 3 dozen monitors I picked this one.  There are a few monitors that routinely garner editors choice awards and best inexpensive 4k screen, and this is either picked as the best or another screen that uses the same panel as this wins.  I'm not one of those guys that buys $5000 tv's and $2000 computer monitors, I just want it to look good, not have stuck pixels, and not be fussy or break down.Well, it looks great out of the box.  I haven't calibrated it yet and I might not bother.  It has a huge window right behind it and we're not seeing any issues with a washed out or ugly display when its backlit by the sunlight.  The stand is extremely flexible, allowing tilt, raise and lower without screws or a lot of work, just pushing it around.One gotcha is that the screen won't do 4k@60hz unless you use displayport and change a setting in the monitor to use DP 1.2.  The default settings with the included displayport cable came up at 30hz until I made the change.  Google it, there are some videos and text instructions on how to get into the monitor menus and flip it from DP 1.1 to 1.2.Anyhow, I was a little pensive about some of these cheap 4k displays and I'm sure the ones that roll out next year with IPS panels and better pulldown and all that other video nerd stuff will be better.  But we like it, the price was right, and unless it dies on me in <2 years I don't feel disappointed at all.I had looked at this and the samsung (which doesn't have as good of a stand), along with some super cheap no-names and ended up with this one for quality (some cheapos had reports of dirt between the screen and coating) and price...it was about $25 cheaper than the samsung when I bought it and both use the same panel.",12,23,11,35,65.7142857142857,34.2857142857143

"120","Plug and Play, plain and simple. The Monitor wants to dominate your sound scheme from the start which is alright since you want to hear how the built in speakers work which is well. After I found that out I just went to sound properties in control panel and switched back to my 7.1 surround. The presets for different scenarios is quite handy, I use standard for watching tv else the flesh tones get too red on game mode or scenery mode. That takes a little playing with. No dead or bright pixels like some have said, not a blemish anywhere. I freaked for a few minutes when my hookup of choice (Display Port 1.2) only had a regular to regular cable when I needed regular to mini, but alas, I found an adapter that came with my Radeon 7950 so I was good to go. 2560x1440 was no question, just incredible! I needed more real estate for video/audio editing and photography and it gave me that compared to my ten year old 24"" 1920x1200. It shows me what my photos really look like, and showing before and after shots side by side is invaluable. I have not even tried to dabble with the sRGB mode yet, I'm just thrilled to not have Photoshop tell me that my monitor is not calibrated properly! One person was right about brightness, it comes out of the box at full brightness, I backed it down by 25%. Contrast is excellent but you may have to up the gamma in games. It was fun to have to go into video options in all my games to up the resolution to 2560x1440! And then to experience the difference in those high-end games just blows my mind! I much prefer 16:9 format rather than 16:10 on my old monitor. I give it 10 stars. Thanks for reading my review.",2,16,14,18,88.8888888888889,11.1111111111111
"121","I ordered the ASUS PB278Q for home because I had been using one at work and was impressed by the picture quality.  A couple of weeks after using the new monitor at home, I noticed that on occasion, the monitor would make an audible 'snap' sound and the picture would flash or go blank for two or three seconds, then come back.  When using for long periods of time, I noticed that the 'snap' would occur every two or three hours.I returned the monitor and received a replacement.  After using the replacement monitor for a while, noticed that it had the same problem.  I didn't immediately request to return the second monitor, and now I'm past the 30 days from when the original was shipped.  I hear that dealing with ASUS can be a hassle and am not looking forward to that.From what I've read, it sounds like the snapping sound could be caused by a bad capacitor in the power supply.  My work purchased dozens of these monitors and has not seen this problem, yet I've seen it with two in a row.

Once again there was a stuck blue pixel in the top left portion of the screen as well as having an almost hazy appearance. Frustrated I ordered another replacement, and called Amazon now that I was going to submit a replacement of a replacement. I was reassured that the process would proceed smoothly. When I received my third monitor, there once again were dead pixels to greet me. I requested a refund, which did not process until after delivery plus 4-5 days. All the while I was using a 1080p monitor on a GTX 1080. Thank God for Amazon's replacement/return process, I can only imagine how much worse and drawn out this could have been. For the price it would have been a good value. Other than the dead pixels the monitor would have been satisfactory. Quality control appears to be a real concern with this model.

"124","I purchased this monitor for use with my 2015 Razer Blade 14"" laptop. The monitor has a great, clean design with solid picture clarity and color accuracy (I'd give it a 9/10). Games look fantastic as well.  I know some reviews have been hit-or-miss as it relates to product quality (dead pixels, color issues, etc.), but mine came flawless. On a technical note - my Razer has a 1.4a HDMI output (GTX 970m GPU) and I am getting 60hz at this monitor's max resolution (2560 x 1440). I knew I would not get 60hz with a 4k display as my Razer is not equipped with a mini DisplayPort or HDMI 2.0, so this was my next best option. If you have a GPU equipped with a higher bandwidth output, I would upgrade to the PB287Q instead. But overall I would say this monitor is great value. You won't be disappointed.",3,9,6,12,75,25
"125","I want to get straight to the point. The displayport problems are so annoying and frustrating, that I may just send this back and get a different monitor. I liked the idea of having an HDMI and DP monitor because that meant I could plug in my PC and my PS3/4 at the same time! Seemed simple in theory. The HDMI works perfectly! I have not yet found a single problem with HDMI. But the DP just REFUSES to work! I searched the internet for answers, and everyone said to just unplug the monitor and plug it back in. No dice. The next logical conclusion was to find the correct drivers. Well that makes sense, I thought. No dice. After contemplating throwing the monitor at a wall, I tried just one more reboot. And it freaking worked out of nowhere! As of yet I have no single idea why it has worked, and I'm far too afraid that if I turn off the computer it wont work again.+ 2560x1440 looks really nice with my HDMI- Displayport problems are a belt sander to my scrotumBuy at your own risk.

"126","Received this monitor from Amazon Warehouse Deals (Prime delivery included) as in ""very good"" condition with mostly notes about packing materials and boxing being damaged.  As far as I could tell, that was it--the actual monitor and parts were all as new--no cosmetic damage anywhere even on the screen (which did not have the usual removable protective film present).  Speaks highly of Amazon's internal processes dictating customer satisfaction.Initial set-up was simple and did not require any instructions. The rear panel connections are oddly positioned under a plastic piece that should come off but apparently does not--requiring you to navigate your cords with a flashlight, sight, and touch (most conveniently this odd piece of plastic  should flip up or simply not be there in the first place).  Once connected, the actual hold is sufficient--cords are going to stay in place.  Connecting the monitor via Display Port 1.2 (HDMI and DP cords both provided) to a single Nvidia GTX970 graphics card was simple. The power cord was shorter than my prior Asus monitor and as such would not reach my UPC power back-up on the floor.  Just another foot would have done it--however since this cord is standard--just using my old cord works fine.Turning it on and adjusting the resolution was simple via personalization and/or Windows 8.1 control panel. There was no need to look at the Nvidia control panel but for a verification that the proper connections had been made and that it was truly running at 60 Hz (which it was, plug and play except for screen resolution).  Then there was the matter of making icons bigger and getting the text leveled out for old eyes.  Control panel made quick work of the icons (had to set at 125% for me), and the Windows true text setting needed some adjustment--even then it took some time to get used to the way text is displayed.  It is different from my 1080 display.  Not liking the initial default screen settings I moved to ""game"" mode (with apparent increases in saturation and contrast).  Prior to testing a game, I made sure via the Nvidia control panel my drivers were up to date and games optimized.Nothing had changed for the game I was going to test -Borderlands 2--everything was still maxed out in 4K resolution.  Opening the game and changing the resolution to 4K showed gorgeous detail as expected.  Now Borderlands may not be the most graphic intensive game, but on previously used Nvidia GTX660, I did not like the performance with everything maxed out (some slow downs at times)--but with the newer Nvidia GTX970 I have run everything full tilt.  There were no perceivable changes in subjective frame rate playing Borderlands 2 maxed out at 4K resolution.  Stunning details and super clear.Nice adjustments on screen height and rotation are available... positive connections horizontal to vertical without being too hard (or too easy) to move about.  Up and down positioning was also straight forward.For the price (a tad over $500), via a Warehouse Deal, this monitor seems to me a great addition to my current set-up.  It is also encouraging me to jump for another GTX970 card just to see if any dramatic differences occur with SLI on any other games I may try.Four stars total: one star off of five for the shorter power cord and the odd piece of plastic requiring you to feel your way to connections.  Actual operation deserves a 5, so maybe 4.4 rounded down?I do love Asus, and this will be my third Asus monitor over the past decade--this pushes the really old (now third wheel) Dell of my desk to eBay!",7,17,10,24,70.8333333333333,29.1666666666667

"134","July 29, 2014: After owning this monitor for a week, it developed a 2 or 3 inch vertical black line as if it had dead pixels. Rebooting usually fixed the problem for a while. It turns out that the problem is related to its interaction with my graphics card. Rebooting was really annoying, but there was another solution. Right clicking on the screen brings up a menu that shows the resolution. There is an advanced settings tab that allows you to change the color rendition. Click the Monitor tab. Change the rendition from true color to high color, but do not accept the change after the graphics card switches. The black streak will be gone for quite a while. This process takes about 30 seconds and seems to last for at least a week or two. Other than this minor annoyance, my review below still stands. Perhaps with other graphics cards, this flaw does not appear. The resolution, clarity, and color rendition of this monitor are great for pictures, games, and work.June 21 2014: The ASUS PB27HQ is probably one of the best monitors you can purchase at a very reasonable price. The monitor arrived without any flaws. Of course, this is day one, so I have no comments on durability. It's a 16:9 ratio monitor (2560:1440), which I usually dislike. But this one has enough pixels in the vertical direction, 1440, so that I can display a full page of text or graphics, which helps getting work done. At the same time, I get extra width to display multiple windows side-by-side. Image quality and out of the box color adjustment are excellent. Viewing and editing photographs produces beautiful results, especially at the high WQHD resolution.  Photo-bugs may want to tune it slightly, but I intend to leave this one at factory settings. All possible cables are supplied, even ancient VGA. I used the HDMI with perfect results. Set up is trivial. 1) Fasten the base, 2) Attach the power cord, 3) Select and attach the video cable to the computer. 4) push the power button (lower right corner), and 5) Select connection using the button just to the left of the power switch.

This is a serious defect, which can't be fixed without taking it apart.

Considerably more than the IPS panel it replaced, but in fairness the panel it replaced was essentially glow-free.Zero ghosting or inverse ghosting that I can detect with the naked eye.

If you're looking for a large, high quality 1440p monitor then you don't really need to look much farther unless you want 21:9 or something curved.My only complaint would be that the speakers aren't very loud. They are loud enough, and they are decent quality, but no one really buys a monitor because they expect the speakers to be amazing. These are definitely good enough, but they probably earn about 7/10 points. My main gripe is that I really just wish they were louder.One selling point for me was also the 75Hz refresh rate, which was a very hard spec to track down.

"139","I originally wrote this as a five-star review just after receiving my monitor, with the caveat that it had one minor flaw - the right side was very slightly brighter than the rest of the panel, easiest to see on grey or white backgrounds (such as 99% of web sites). It took me several days to even notice this and initially I thought it was just me being super nitpicky, but staring at the thing every day for a couple of weeks, it ended up really bothering me. I couldn't stop looking at the right side of the screen and comparing it to the center or left. I returned that monitor thinking it was probably defective, but my replacement turned out to be exactly the same.The backlighting pattern is the same on both of my monitors: the left and center of the screen are equally bright and uniform. Then about 6 inches from the right edge on the bottom, there's a *dark* patch that happens to sit right in front of where the power cable plugs in - this monitor does have an internal power supply. Further to the right, the panel gets slightly but consistently brighter all the way to the edge, over about the last 5"" of the screen from top to bottom. I'm usually okay with some level of unevenness in monitor backlighting, but most monitors have a more symmetrical (or random) pattern. Having that one dark patch and then one side of the panel being brighter is distracting even though it's not a huge brightness difference.So why do I even give it four stars? Because otherwise, there is nothing I don't like about this monitor, and I think for most purposes, the uniformity wouldn't be an issue. An office worker isn't even going to care; and you can only really see it on light, solid backgrounds, so gamers, photographers or video editors wouldn't even notice it. And technically speaking, all LCD monitors have imperfect uniformity, many worse than this. It's also still a great deal at around $200. Even a few years ago, a 1080p, 23"" IPS monitor with build quality and features like this would have cost $1,000. Some of the specifically great things about it:* IPS panel - accurate, natural color and very little off-axis color shift* 6ms pixel response - that's good for an IPS panel and makes it suitable for gaming, not just photographic/video work* Pretty excellent build quality (notwithstanding my second unit's slightly imperfect bezel) - it's still plastic, but it's the thick stuff like PC manufacturers used to use; feels like you'd think an IBM would if they still made hardware* All the ports you'll ever need - VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort - this thing's both backward compatible and future-proof* Matte screen - in fact the whole monitor's matte, not a glossy surface to be found anywhere (yay!)* No ""graininess"" or ""sparkle"" - I've seen this on some matte screens, this one is super-clear* If you want them, speakers and a USB hub built in - the speakers are extremely well hidden if you have external ones* VGA, DVI, USB, audio and DisplayPort cables are all included - just no HDMI for some reason* Sturdy and versatile stand that tilts, swivels and doesn't wobbleTo expand on that last point a bit, I noticed in my searching that one big area that separates ""cheap"" monitors from more expensive ones is actually the stand. In a ~$200 monitor, you're lucky if you get so much as tilt, much less height or swivel adjustment, and reviewers always seem to complain about wobble, even just from typing. I've even seen people complain about their monitors being permanently off-axis from the factory, sitting slightly crooked on their non-adjustable stands, *and* wobbling when they type. No matter how good a monitor is otherwise, that would drive me nuts and would definitely make me return it.But this stand is amazing - it's a real selling point! Tilt, height adjustment, and swivel are all possible. It will even rotate the screen 90 degrees for portrait use - not many monitors at this price can do that! And it's chunky and solid - no wobble here. The only minor quibble is that it's a tiny bit ""front-heavy"" because the screen sits basically in line with the front edge of the stand, so if you bump into it from the back, it'd probably be pretty easy to knock it over (luckily I'm using it at home with a wall behind it). I'd have liked to see the front edge of the stand extended by about another inch, but that's really being nitpicky with a generally excellent stand.Lastly, some early reviewers of this monitor complained about crosshatching and light bleed - I'll just say that I see neither of these *at all*, and again, I am a tough crowd. I've looked for them. My first monitor was made in December of 2013 and the second in March of 2014, so if these really were problems at one point, they may have mainly affected earlier units. That's one of the benefits of buying a model that's a little bit older. (Of course, I've never read about uneven backlighting on the early units, so...)I did a lot of looking around and I still don't think there's a better monitor at this price. You can always spend $500 or more on a really high end, professional monitor that's pre-calibrated from the factory and will have really minimal uniformity problems, light bleed or other issues, plus an even better S-IPS or other kind of panel. But for those on a budget, this is a really good monitor as long as you're not particularly sensitive to screen uniformity issues.",33,46,13,79,58.2278481012658,41.7721518987342
"140","This was my first IPS/PLS display and i have to say that it was my greatest purchase.ProsThe monitor comes out of the box ready to play but the settings for the brightness were a bit too high. I recommend pushing it back to 50%The speakers are loud enough for you to make your next door neighbor on the other side of the wall angry. They also sound great.The quality of the pictures and videos i tested were simply amazing. I had only been using a TN panel till this monitor so i guess any IPS display would amaze me.ConsThe buttons...

"141","Excellent monitor - in use as the main monitor in a digital music studio set up.  No complaints thus far.  I see none of the artifacts and other negative observations on other reviews.  I will attempt to use it for photo editing later in the year, and will update this review at that time.  The stand's positioning flexibility far exceeded my expectations.  I was concerned that this monitor had been around for 4 years and might be technologically obsolete, but it has turned out to be an awesome value.I have my Apple Mac Mini connected via DisplayPort, and a 2nd connection via HDMI to an HDMI Matrix splitter so I can watch cable, Apple TV, or blu-ray content.  The various color shadings available make this an awesome monitor to watch movies on, and I was not distracted by slow refreshes in action scenes.  It Is a good idea to walk through all the settings in the menu,  as you will find this monitor to be a step above both your TV and your typical PC monitor, in terms of flexibility.  Check VividPixel settings for pixel smoothing for example.  You can make the display as sharp or smooth as you need dependent on what you are doing with it.  I like choices, don't you?  There is even a calibration for gaming, where you can calibrate how the monitor tracks for 1st person shooters, I suspect.I am using the monitor with Apple Logic Pro X, which offers up a TON of data across multiple windows.  The additional screen real estate from running at a higher resolution is a gift.  I now no longer need two screens.  I have an older G5 Mac and a Windows PC that I will be connecting and will update this review later with feedback on how that goes.All in all, nothing negative to report, all positive on this front.",6,12,6,18,66.6666666666667,33.3333333333333
"142","This monitor started out pretty good, with good performance and image quality. Physically, I'm not in love with the design, but my complaints are minor and I was willing to overlook them.What makes this a 1 star review is the short duration in which the monitor functioned fully and the ASUS RMA process. Within a year, the DisplayPort input became flaky and eventually failed, requiring any DisplayPort devices to use an adapter with the DVI or HDMI inputs. Once I got around to starting the RMA for the monitor, I was displeased that there is no advance replacement option (even at my own cost) and that I was required to pay shipping to ASUS. Not cool.After waiting a couple weeks for the repairs to be completed and the monitor returned to me, I received it in the condition shown in the pictures. The  stand components were dismantled and put in the box without padding, causing pieces to snap off and the components to be marred. What's worse, the padded display component has the bezel all but falling off the monitor and as such I'm not even bothering to plug it in for fear of a short circuit, or worse, a fire.ASUS will *never* get my business again, and anyone I know will hear strong words from me encouraging them to take the same stance. Very poor business practice ASUS.",11,7,-4,18,38.8888888888889,61.1111111111111
"143","This monitor works with the new 15"" 2014 Macbook Pro Retina with the Iris Pro graphics card.  You'll need the latest version of Mavericks or simply upgrade to Yosemite OS.  The monitor comes with a Display port cable so the only thing extra you'll need is a Mini-Displayport to Displayport adapter (male to female).  Make sure the mini-DP is Thunderbolt port compatible.  I originally had a female-female miniDP to DP adapter thinking I could use my existing Thunderbolt cable (version 2) to work but no luck and was forced to use the provided cable with a new adapter going right into my laptop instead.  I also have Apple's Thunderbolt display connected to the other TB port to support a dual-display setup.I successfully mounted the display to my VESA wall mount with no problems at all.  However, the provided power cable is a little too short to hide the cabling into the wall mount arm and had to spring for a 6' power cable.Pros: Only $600; 4K resolution with adequate quality; matte finish;Cons: TN panel but for $600 what do you expect?; Short power cable;  Menu buttons behind but you eventually get used to that.",2,8,6,10,80,20
"144","The ASUS PB278Q is exactly the monitor I am looking for, and at a great value.  For up to now and for so long Apple held the best WQHD, or WQXGA, monitor for users that needed more than 1080p HD resolutions. However, the cost was well beyond what I would consider to spend.  There were very few other manufactures, as well, that I can find, that could not curb their cost as well. I do a LOT of graphic design work both in 3D and 2D areas, animation included. I needed a monitor that was more than the FHD(Full HD 1080p) that I was using now. I found it in this Monitor from ASUS.  It is everything it claims to be. The colors are brilliant, the picture is bright and clear, even sharp.  Though it has 5ms response, it has the some technology (Probably the SPLENDID) that works better for animations than my FHD monitors of other manufacturers, both less than 1 year old! On the Physical side, the monitor comes with some cable management, for you have 4 different input capabilities plus power.  The monitor can be physically turned from Landscape to Portrait. Cool feature but I think I will use it rarely, if any.  The monitor sits on a stand that has a slide that counter weighs the monitor, which allow you to move the monitor freely up and down to the eye level you want. Very Nice!I did my due diligence and checked out other Reputable and High-End manufacturers. First, for the Technology, 2nd for Ports and Functionality and third for the Cost, it was hard to find another monitor that could top this monitor. Even the cables are of very good quality.I am glad I selected it.  Are there Cons to this monitor?  Not that I found in technology, ..YET!",2,19,17,21,90.4761904761905,9.52380952380952
"145","This monitor is amazing. While it lacks USB through-ways I can live with it, as its performance on just about every other level is stellar. While the colors are a bit bright and not exactly providing the deepest black shading, the level of detail is superb. The ability to rotate the screen to landscape or vertical position is priceless and the adjustable height is a dream! So easy to move up and down and has self tensioning to keep it in place. My only issue, if you can call it that, is the placement of the buttons for the menues etc. Having them on the backside of the screen and marked by dots on the front makes it a bit of a learning process to navigate the menus without accidentally selecting something you didnt mean to or accidentally pressing the back button. Overall though and for the price, you can NOT get a better monitor. Sleek, crisp, affordable, and capable of some beautiful graphics. I have not tested the on board sound yet, but I am not exactly an audiophile anyhow, and if you have a sound system you would be mad to use a monitors sound anyhow.

"146","Purchased June 2013 from Amazon.  Spent extra $s to get a professional grade monitor with great reviews.  Love the monitor but... support is really really bad.  If you depend on a monitor to do your work I recommend you steer clear of ASUS.The DVI port failed in October.  Now after more than a month, 7 phone calls and multiple on-line support chats... nada.  The southern Indiana support people are nice, but nothing comes of it.-10/11, 2013.  First ASUS support contact was via on-line chat.  I was mis-advised what to do.  It turns out the monitor comes with a ""Rapid Replacement"" option and I assumed that was what was happening.  Wrong.- 10/22  Contacted ASUS live chat support again 10/22, had the RMA changed.  Told that they contact another part of the company for a replacement stock check and that I should get an e-mail within 2 days with the cross ship logistics.- 10/30  Called ASUS support since there had been no contact.  They hadn't gotten a response to the first stock check to ACI and he'll resend the stock check.  If they are out of the model I have I'll be offered another model.  I should get a response within a couple of days...- 11/1  Called ASUS support to follow-up since there had been no response.  If ACI doesn't have it then ""we go to sales"".  ""Wait until Monday or Tuesday"".-  11/6  Called ASUS support again.  No response from stock check, will resend and cc: management.-  11/7  Called ASUS support again.  ""That model is not in stock"".  ""We'll offer an upgraded model.""  ""You should receive an e-mail with the offer today.""-  11/11  Still nothing.  Called ASUS support.  ""Wait another 24 hours""...This is really getting old.-  11/13  Still nothing.  Called ASUS support.  Talked to multiple support people.  ""They have something reserved but we don't know what it is.""  I should get an e-mail today asking if I'll accept the replacement.-  11/14 (afternoon) Still nothing.  Called ASUS support.  Asked for a manager.  He will escalate, he confirmed and said he would sent me an e-mail by the end of the day with status.- 11/15  (11:00am Pacific)  Still nothing...  the saga continues.During this saga I checked Yelp for ASUS Support feedback.

"147","Phenomenal monitor for money! It was a steal at just $549. I went from a LG 23"" 1080p LED monitor to this 1440p monster and the difference is night and day. It is like putting on glasses for the fist time, or going from SD to HD TV. After comparing my old 1080p monitor to a Dell U2711 1440p at work, I realized the glory that is 1440p and just had to step up to a higher resolution.I have yet to do a side-by-side comparison of the ASUS PB278Q to the Dell UltraSharp U2711 (FYI/BTW, there is a new version - the Dell U2713HM availoable for around $800), but the ASUS seems to be as good as if not better than the U2711 in every area, especially in terms of text legibility. The ASUS provides sharp and clear text whereas the U2711 text is often blurry and difficult to read.This is a great monitor for just about any task. I use my PC for mundane things like web-browsing and word-processing to CPU-intensive tasks like gaming and geospatial analysis via ESRI ArcGIS. The extra screen real estate is great for essentially everything, especially Photoshop and Illustrator.Gaming at 1440p is fantastic! While it may not have the fastest response time (5ms is more than adequate), it is great for the casual gamer who does not need a monitor 120Hz refresh rate or a 1ms response time. Crysis 3 is just a joy to play, as is Arma 3, AC:III, Deus Ex:HR, FarCry 3 and Metro: LL.*Pros*PriceNo dead pixels5ms response timeDecent speakers (but nothing to write home about)1440pIncludes all necessary cables (VGA, DVI-D, DisplayPort, HDMI)*Cons*No USB portsOSD not as nice as those in modern Dell monitors",7,21,14,28,75,25
"148","Product itself is great, but the box was clearly opened before I received it.  I was suspicious so I took pictures of everything.  Once opened, all the cables were just ""stuck"" inside, all the bags were previously opened, and there was no protective film over the screen or any of the screens parts.  The screen had finger prints all over it.  However there is no damage, and no dead pixels.  The item was not damaged, but I purchased a new product, not an open box item.

"149","as of 02/2016 this was the way to go for 4K for me.  I am doing photo editing so I need the extra resolution for pinpoint accuracy.  You get that. In the box is the power cable and an HDMI cable as well as a Display Port cable.  I NEEDED the Display port cable to get the 4K .  ONCE you can figure out how to set your video card, some smoke and mirrors, watch a few video tutorials, call ASUS who are about NO HELP at all!  Play around, study the internet and 7 hours later Whala! DisplayPort 3840 X 2160 @60 HZ.  (The obtaining the 60HZ was the hard part to get.)  ASUS Support on the internet gave me some clues but I found it not to be windows 10 friendly.  I called them and was on hold for over 45 minutes 3 times with no answer.  The first (Live Chat) Johnathan Ended the conversation soon as I typed out my problem.  Appilonia Only got me to the you need the Display port cable part and bailed out on me.  And after that They never answered the phone, Live chat or by e mail again.  I figured it out. (By accident so I can't even tell you how)  HOWEVER once it is set up.  What a pleasure to work Photo editing with.  The stand is incredible.  (As well as the picture and controls menu)  The stand allows you to lift the screen from 1.5 inches off the desk to almost 7.5 inches off the desk with ONE finger!  Once you get it up you can Rotate the screen from horizontal to vertical view!  This is GREAT for photo editing as you can look at pictures taken with the camera in a vertical orientation without compressing the photo.  Makes for easy editing.  And it's also a great feature to flip the screen this way for the 50 times you will be dealing with the cables while installing, or later on when you want to add or switch cables.  This articulation of the screen is a great feature and I might mention it tilts greatly in both vertical and horizontal. You can get the perfect height, angle and orientation with this display!  EASILY!  Paying over $400 i feel it was certainly worth the money, really wish ASUS was more supportive.  I actually always try to buy ASUS because I never have to deal with their support, and good thing.

"150","Great product to use with my MBPr.It works perfectly, the image is very crisp. There's a lot of screen real estate, perfect for getting work done.Colors and viewing angles are not great, but OK. It has many different display modes (scenery, gaming, theater...) but they only make the display worse IMHO.The adjustable stand is the reason I bought this one vs the Samsung, and it works as advertised.All in all, it's the best value for the money if you're looking for a mid-range screen to work on. I've already ordered a second one.The only issue I have is I can't activate scaling when using the DisplayPort connection. It works fine over HDMI though, and the fact that it's only 30Hz (vs 60Hz in DisplayPort) does not bother me.

"154","Unless you have your displays side-by-side i.e. not tilted towards you whatsoever, viewing angle is a big deal. Fortunately, the PB278Q with its IPS tech supports wider viewing angles. I thought I screwed up the color profile on my second monitor but it was actually just the poor viewing angle. I already had one PB278Q so I got a second one to replace my viewing-angle-challenged 1920x1080 monitor.Things to consider:If you have poor vision and have not used a 2560x1440 27"" monitor in person, I would highly recommend doing so before purchasing one. The pixel density is relatively high (which is usually a good thing), but that also means the text will be smaller. Not all applications support text zooming adjustment gracefully and if your monitor is too far away you will be squinting to see what is easily visible with a smaller resolution/monitor. The Retina MacBook Pro has high pixel density but its default resolution is half (1440x900) of what the display supports (2880x1800) to improve readability. You can always opt to use a smaller resolution, but that kind of defeats the purpose of getting such a large/expensive monitor.Some displays do have a problem with certain images / color combinations on the screen where they will emit a high-frequency sound. I have had zero problems with PB278Q in this department. I thought I was going crazy until a friend of mine had the same problem and so I recommended this monitor to him, and he was happy to find it wasn't a universal problem. Both instances involved Dell monitors, but I assume it was an isolated problem with those two monitors or models.I haven't had any dead pixel problems with either monitor, but every manufacturer produces products with defects including ASUS. An ASUS laptop I bought about 6 years ago had a couple of dead pixels in the lower right-hand corner. I've bought several laptops and displays from them since then without incident.",14,11,-3,25,44,56

I was contemplating getting some 30inch U3014's from Dell, but these stood out as great devices for far less cash, so I jumped on them.  I don't think the extra size would have been worth it, considering I've got three screens!  It's true that you really cannot have too much screen real estate, but these are pretty giant.  You actually have to move your head even with just two of them side by side.  I used VESA mounts as mine are mounted to the wall, that worked great as well.  I didn't realize these had speakers in them until I noticed some extra noise when I first fired up some audio... wish they would have left them off, but they can be muted and that silences them as far as I can tell.",4,10,6,14,71.4285714285714,28.5714285714286

I went with the ASUS because other reviews said glare was not an issue and I agree with that. I had no problem with missing pixels like others had noted.Setup was a little difficult since there was not clear guidance on how to do it. The resolution was poor with HDMI and DVI. One review mentioned using an Apple MiniDisplay Port to Dual Link DVI adapter. I found out that the MDP plug fits into the Thunderbolt port and that the  ASUS supplied DVI cord completes the connection. With that setup I got maximum resolution and a great looking monitor.  Note that the Apple adapter is another $95.I would give this monitor 5 stars except for the setup difficulty and another glitch where the monitor will suddenly go black or snowy.

"158","I purchased this monitor by mistake, but since it has arrived I decided to turn it on and play around to see its performance. First of all, it indeed has some minor bleeding in the left and right corners, but almost unnoticeable when I watch a movie. Now there is the only way to battle with milky hues that were mentioned in the previous review and make this monitor somewhat decent. You MUST run the monitor using NVIDIA settings (if you have NVidia graphics card of course). I connected the monitor through DVI cable to my GTX 1070. First it may complain that ""there is no connection"", but all you need to do is unplug the cable and plug it again. After this, turn the monitor on, and install ASUS PB287Q driver (there is no CD included, so you have to download it from internet and know how to install a driver through Device Manager manually, because it's not an executable file). Then, the monitor will be recognized as ASUS, and not a Generic Monitor. Second, run the display through Splendid on sRGB or Standard mode with 0 or 25 VividPixels, and open Nvidia Control Panel>Display>Adjust Desktop color settings. If you have only one monitor, go to 2 option (Choose how color is set) and select ""Use NVIDIA settings"". Now for my taste I had to adjust the sliders like this: a) Brightness - 45%, b) Contrast - between 65 - 70%, c) Gamma - 1.00, d) Digital vibrance - leave it at 50% or slide to 55%. e) Hue - 0. Click Apply. Then go to change Resolution, select 3840x2160 if it is not selected just yet, refresh rate is by defaukt 60Hz. Go to 3 optios (Apply the following settings): Desktop color depth - make it Highest (32-bit), Output color format - RGB, Output color depth  - make it 10bpc and lat Output dynamic range - make it Full instead of Limited.Now remember that your video player may play movies using its own settings too. If you want to change that, play a video file on one half of the screen and Go to NVIDIA Control Panel>Video>Adjust video color settings. Now watch a video frame with the native video player settings and with the NVIDIA settings. Again, here I had to adjust contrast by 60%. Also here go to Advanced and select Full Dynamic range as well. Try it and see if you like video image now. If you mess up, you always can reset settings in NVIDIA Control Panel ""Restore defaults in the upper right window) and Reset changes under Monitors menu next to each mode.In Windows 7, I also adjusted the size of text into 150% through Control  Panel>Appearance and Personalization>Display and then adjusted Clear Type text so the fonts are crisp and readable without a need of more than 25 VividPixels (which will make lots of noise on photos and is not advised by Tom's Hardware and other respectable review channels). In addition, I went to Control  Panel>Appearance and Personalization>Personalization>Window Color and Appearance and selected ""Advanced Appearance Settings"". Here you can increase (A) Icon item font (!) size to 16 anbd (B) Menu item size to 27 and font (!) size to 14. You can change a font into Arial or other if you like, but i left it on default.Looks like the tweaking part is over. ASUS CAN display nice colors, but I am still unhappy that it takes so much to get into the crispy contrast that my old display had right out of the box - Dell SP2309W, which is 23 inch, has 2048x1152 resolution and stunning 80,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. Another minor issue, which is albeit annoying is that I cannot push the icon next to very edge of the right side of the monitor. Do not know how to fix that.

"159","Bought it for a company client I'm working with, since this costs a fraction of what a professional IPS monitor such as NEC or Eizo would cost... I have a MultiSync PA271w with CCFL backlight, and I would say the Asus is about 80% as good as the NEC. The color accuracy is uite good. Viewing angle is wide, but there is noticeable color shift if viewed at an angle.  Light bleeding is well controlled. The black level is lacking.  A pure black image appear quite gray to the naked eye.I like the menu system, very easy and quick to work with.  The included speaker is very weak, murky sounding and is faced toward the back of the monitor, but it's there if you need a speaker...  Works with both HDMI and DisplayPort.Calibrated with i1 Display Pro, and as other reviewers said, it was factory calibrated and only need very slight calibration.",4,8,4,12,66.6666666666667,33.3333333333333
"160","I don't feel like writing a review right now, but this monitor does deserve a 5 star rating, and at least a few good words. Maybe I'll get around to writing a better review once I've had the monitor for about 12 months.*Display port*Very high build quality*Screen position is fully customizable with 5 axis rotation and also height adjustment*Very, very accurate color pallet, blacks are very dark for the price point, they are not TRUE black however, there is a little bit of grey scale*Ghosting is minimal and not noticeable*There is some back light bleed on the corners, but at the right viewing angle, it is almost unnoticeable*Speakers work, but are horrible, only use in an absolute bind*3 year warranty backed by Asus's great return program, buy with confidence. I've dealt with Asus suport in the past, they really do have amazing customer service; it's not a myth.Overall, this is probably going to be the best 1080p IPS monitor on the market without stepping into the ridiculous price ranges. I really don't think there is a better IPS monitor at this price point. Some reviewers have stated the quality is on par with a Dell Ultra Sharp, I've never seen one (Dell) in person, but I can say that this Asus does indeed look very, very nice.I initially received a panel with a dead pixel, and one of the face buttons was recessed on the right side. Amazon promptly sent me a replacement and provided a return shipping label, hassle free using the 100% automated system. After inspecting the replacement monitor and concluding it was flawless I chalked up the original to just slipping past inspection and that it was not an indication of quality on all PB238Q monitors.",6,17,11,23,73.9130434782609,26.0869565217391

"164","I purchased this display to use with my 2011 MacBook Pro. I also purchased a Mini Display Port to Display Port cable because the three included cables (DVI, HDMI, and Display Port) were not compatible with the Thunderbolt port on my Mac. I use it mainly for coding, basic Photoshop editing, Word and Excel, and an occasional movie or video game. Out of the box the color is good although I do not use it for high-end photo editing or graphic design. The only adjustment I made was to crank down the brightness so it didn't blind me when the lights in my office were dimmed. The stand is very functional. In addition to easy tilt, swivel, and height adjustments, the display can be rotated from landscape to portrait orientation.Minor complaints: the Display Port cable carries sound to the mini jack port on the back of the display but there is no system level (keyboard) volume control if you plug speakers in that way. Also, there are no USB ports on the display.Big complaint: sometimes the display will not wake up from sleep when used with a MacBook Pro. After about two weeks this happened to mine and I ended up exchanging it for the same model. Amazon is absolutely the best when it comes to returns and exchanges. After a few weeks the same problem happened with my replacement monitor. This time I Googled a little deeper and found a solution. When the display will not wake from sleep you have to unplug the power cord to reset it. Turning it off with the power switch does not reset the sleep circuitry. Crawling under the desk to turn my display back on sucks. My solution was to set Display Sleep to never in the Energy Saver settings and then use a black screen saver. I shut down and turn everything off when I leave for the day so this works for me.Overall, this is a great display. 2560 x 1440 resolution for $400! How great is that? And the color is good, too. I took off one star for the sleep problem. That may be a deal killer for some people but not for me. I plan to get another one for my wife's MacBook Air.",7,11,4,18,61.1111111111111,38.8888888888889

I bought it mostly for photo editing, no disappointment's. Light room 5 looks great on this monitor. Plus if you go to the Asus sight you can download a program that lets you put four applications on screen at once, its called Asus multi frame. All the cables come with this monitor, HDMI, Display port, and DVI, so you don't have to buy any thing to connect. If you want to run this monitor at 2560 by 1440 resolution you need to upgrade your video card.

I'd give it five stars but for a couple of complaints:* It's silly that the PinP window isn't completely in the corner of the screen.  It's set in by half an inch, which is just a plain waste of screen real estate.* There's no simple way in the user interface to toggle between PinP mode and non-PinP mode (or at least not that I've discovered).",3,2,-1,5,40,60

"170","I had recently gone from a 24"" 1440 to a 27"" 1080 (Asus) display, the lack of vertical resolution that I was used had me looking for a 27"" 1440 display after a month. I bought this display after looking long and hard at buying a knock down 2560x1440 from one of the Korean sellers.  Based on my wants/needs no dead pixels, easy vesa mount and I prefer on screen control display, I opted to spend the extra money and go with this model.  The display mounted nice on my existing vesa mount, the included dual link dvi cable hooked up to the graphics card (EVGA 680SC).  One of the other reviewers had an issue with cables claiming Alienware users should use a mini display port cable.  I'm not sure where they are coming from with this, mini display ports with PC's are and option to run multiple monitors (AMD eyefinity).  Considering the resolution of this display the typical user won't be running 3 of these displays with the current crop of video cards.  The mini display connection is a Mac issue (keep in mind it WAS a Mac propriety design).  Looking at the apple info page the mac dual link to mini adapter runs at 1920x1200, why pay for a 2560x1440 display if you are running at a lower res?  Bottom line the dual link cable is the the connection to use for this display the other connections should be for occasional use to connect your lower res hardware. With general use I have not encountered a dead pixel, I have not run a special app to see if there are any.  Another fine ASUS product.",7,4,-3,11,36.3636363636364,63.6363636363636
"171","This monitor is beautiful. The colors are vibrant, clear. The bevel is a perfect subtle matte finish. You can turn off the annoying power indicator light (honestly why do monitors even have that anymore).But it has a crippling problem recognizing DisplayPort. Google ""asus PB278Q displayport detection issue"" and you will find hundreds of unresolved threads with people complaining about their Asus giving them the dreaded ""no signal"" while using DisplayPort. This usually happens to me when switching between my TV connected by HDMI and this monitor. If I switch the display mode in windows to output to only the second monitor (my TV), windows will forget the monitor, and the next time I boot up, it will fail to send its specifications to Windows, and Windows will be unable to output the right signal. It only happens sometimes; It's very temperamental, like all of the most annoying tech problems. The only way to fix it is to disconnect the power from the monitor, reconnect and turn it back on. I can prevent this from happening by choosing ""duplicate"" and simply turning off the monitor.I can't really say it's a dealbreaker, though. This monitor is the most beautiful one I've ever owned. It's incredibly bright; I actually have it running at 45% brightness in my basement room, even with light coming in through the windows. 100% is ridiculously bright for the setting in which I use it. I have seen no ghosting or bleeding, and I have noticed no lag, even while playing first person shooter games. I'm a fan of simplistic, minimalistic design, and I hate fancy over-designed bevels, so the design of the monitor is perfect for me. It's all rectangles with very subtle curves on the corners, much like IKEA furniture design, so it looks great on my desk and doesn't distract me from what is on the screen. It makes me want to upgrade my speakers to something to better match the simplistic, angular, all-black motif.This monitor is a fantastic buy, but don't expect it to be completely frustration-free.",19,16,-3,35,45.7142857142857,54.2857142857143

"176","Great monitor, it does what it's supposed to do.  Images look sharp and great.  It runs at 2560x1440 resolution, exactly matching the maximum possible resolution of dual-link DVI.  That's what I use, and it looks beautiful.  I standardized on DVI because that's what all of my devices can produce natively (including my trusty early-2008 MacBook Pro, which maxes out at precisely this resolution).There's a major usability quirk, though.  Whenever your video signal is interrupted for any reason, even if it's for a small fraction of a second, the monitor automatically switches to a different video input!This is frustrating, because I use a DVI switchbox, and every time I switch sources, the monitor flipped to VGA!  The only workaround is to standardize on only one input source.  Don't ever plug more than one input into this monitor at the same time.I eventually used a second monitor for VGA, to work around this problem.  I used Asus tech support and they said there was no way to turn off this ""feature"", unfortunately.This monitor also forces you to wait through an ASUS ""splash screen"" every time you turn the monitor on.  That gets rather old.  I don't need to sit through an ""Inspiring Innovation - Persistent Perfection"" mini-commercial every time!  It gets annoying having to wait.  There's also no way to turn off this ""feature"".If the video input is interrupted for a slightly longer period of time (assuming you have only one video connection plugged in), the monitor will turn itself off.  Guess what, no way to turn this ""feature"" off either!  How frustrating.  Whenever my computer goes into low-power mode from being left unattended for a while, I have to manually turn the monitor on again, by pressing the power button, it won't just come back on again when the video signal is resumed.  And then there's the mini-commercial again!I wish the thing would just sit on the video source that I had selected, permanently, and never change, and never turn itself off.  Would it be too hard for Asus to do this?  Evidently so.The monitor does have a really good stand, with just enough friction and weight to hold it nicely into place, while still allowing it to be set to a variety of angles and rotations to suit your needs.  I can rotate it 90 degrees, in order to use it in vertical mode, which is great for coding.  Unfortunately, it only rotates in one direction, to the right.  It's exactly the wrong direction from what would be needed in order to lift the video cables to a nice easy angle for access!  I wish they had chosen to make the monitor rotate in the opposite direction instead, or better yet, allow it to rotate 180 degrees to allow choice of direction.Although this monitor is nice and big, the cables connect at a surprisingly tight angle.  It would have been nice if Asus would have positioned the connectors at a more friendly angle, perhaps with a shield at the back to cover them up.  Instead, Asus tries to hide the cables from sight by making them cram in at an awkward 90 degree angle behind another bend.  This is not the greatest design, and it's probably bad for the cables over time, because they have to be bent in order to fit.Asus does include cables, though.  In addition to the power cord, you get 1 video cord of each type: VGA, DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort.  The included DVI cable is dual-link, so it will work at the maximum resolution of this monitor.Also, the description said that it came with speakers built-in.  I don't see any holes in the monitor where the speakers would be.  Maybe they're sealed up entirely in the plastic?  I don't use any video cables with audio (I use only DVI and VGA video), so can't test this.I wouldn't use this monitor for sound.  There's no convenient volume control, you have to go through the menus just to access the volume control, so using it every day for sound would be a pain.  There's no headphone jack on the front, either, which would have been nice to have.Another nice thing would have been a built-in USB hub in the monitor, as many monitors have.  Considering Asus is known for throwing in all sorts of silly features and gimmicks, in order to distinguish themselves, this is a rather surprising omission.Don't let the negative tone of this review get you the wrong idea.  I'm still rather happy with this monitor, it's a great step up from what I used to have.  I'm just pointing out its quirks, in hopes that somebody at Asus will read this and make the next monitor even better.Josh",16,30,14,46,65.2173913043478,34.7826086956522
"177","Purchased two of these for development work, and run them both off of a Macbook Pro (13"" retina). They are positioned vertically.

"179","Highly recommended. Seemed solidly made as I assembled it. (I turned one screw, plumbing the limits of my mechanical abilities). Small intakes of breath occur as I re-watch some of my favorite movies and am startled by this displays images.The details: I had a 3-year old Dell U24xxx IPS 24-in monitor at 1920x1200 over HDMI. The ASUS was to be a second monitor. Both were to be attached to a 3-year old HP DV7 laptop (i7 chip - 4 cores) running Windows 7 64 bit ""premium"". normally at less than 20% of capacity; The HP has a Radeon 1 GB video adapter whose maximum resolution seems to be 1920 x 1200. I bought a USB 3.0 video adapter to provide the native 2560 x 1440 resolution of the ASUS panel over a USB Displayport connection (which my laptop did not have). I use the computer for high-quality music playback, video, and some minor web surfing.With minimal calibration (using Microsoft's free Win 7 tool) and using the ASUS monitor's ""RGB"" setting, results are most pleasing. I am seeing text that seems laser etched and not too small; I use these displays at about one to two feet away. Revisiting the film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" illustrates how colors are rendered more subtly and, I suspect, accurately than on the (3-year old) Dell. Old, badly faded prints of black and white movies are much more clearer, and I am seeing a great deal of new detail in just about everything. Flesh tones are rendered far more naturally than on the Dell. There is no comparison in that regard.I had anticipated potential problems in the form of, perhaps, buggy operation (of the USB-to-Displayport video adapter), but the whole thing (i.e., laptop + USB video adapter + two external monitors) seems to be doing quite well. The USB/Displayport software consumes some additional CPU; the laptop runs at a higher temperature than before and the fan is (it seems) almost always on. Otherwise, no quibbles.The 3 year warranties on this ASUS were a draw for me. I registered at the manufacturer's web site, but not sure if I was successful (no confirmation email).I did have a bit of a rocky start. I ordered another manufacturer's 32-inch panel (which, although attractive in design, is more like a television), but I was unable to assemble it out of the box. Despite Herculean efforts and the enlisting of an auto mechanic's aid, the panel would not attach to the stand. While frustrating, it, perhaps, turned out to my benefit (i.e., the ASUS monitor). While I was waiting for a return-and-replace to transpire, I tried the ASUS monitor, and romance blossomed. And, after some reflection, in a glorious burst of rationalization, I decided that a 24 and 27 inch monitor pair was more symmetrically pleasing than a 24 and 32 inch duo. And I still think so.",8,15,7,23,65.2173913043478,34.7826086956522

If you have a flimsy desk and a cat who likes to jump up on things . . . don't get it or it will end up on the floor. And that would be a lot of wasted money for a fantastic product.

"182","The best monitor I've ever bought and over many years I have bought some very expensive CRTs and LCDs like a $2000 Nanao 17inch CRT and a $2000 NEC flat panel.Why I love this monitor? First the 4K resolution for the price. When I first used this monitor I was a little bit disappointed by the 'washed' colors at non native resolutions like at 1920x1028. At this resolution the blacks didn't look very black and other things but when I bought a true 4K graphics card and ran it in native 4K mode everything fit into place, great colors and crisp text using the Display Port output.The cheap ($125) graphics card I bought to drive this beast is an ASUS GTX750, maybe gamers would be disappointed with this card but for for my needs it does the job without spending +$500 for a high end graphics card.When I first connected the graphics card and the monitor it only displayed 4K (3840x2160) at 30Hz, according to the monitors specs it can do 60Hz at this resolution so after doing some reading and going into the monitor's settings I found the problem. The monitor comes pre-set to use display port 1.1 so after changing the setting to display port 1.2 I was able to use it at 60Hz refresh rate.I have owned this monitor for over a week, I hope it keeps working the same for many years to come.",5,7,2,12,58.3333333333333,41.6666666666667

"185","It's a great monitor. Pretty good before Calibration. nearly perfect AFTER calibration.Before Calibration, the monitors Gamma is a bit off.. making blacks and dark colors appear a bit washed out or grey.Not too much, but just enough to notice. White point is also slightly off without calibration.And these slight issues really can't be corrected with the monitors built-in options and controls.There's a reason this isn't under the ""Pro-Art"" series of monitors.The monitor still looks very good, but it's worth noting that the colors and greyscale are not 100% accurate out of the box.Viewing angles top to bottom and side to side are great. My unit has no noticeable light bleed either.After calibration, using a Spyder4Elite, things improve. White point looks perfect, gamma is corrected, and colors are accurate. The monitor measured with 100% SRGB coverage, which is the standard all content is mastered in, making it perfect for games, netflix, youtube... etc.As for AdobeRGB, which some photographers might care about, I measured 80% coverage. Please keep in mind, Adobe RGB only applies to material shot with the AdobeRGB setting and with software supporting the AdobeRGB standard... basically photographers with nice cameras using photoshop and other high-end software. Games, movies, and all internet content is mastered in the SRGB standard. applying AdobeRGB to this type of content will OVER SATURATE the colors much more than intended. It's worth noting that the equivalent Pro-Art series monitor is advertised to have nearly 100% Adobe RGB coverage, which might make it a better fit for some users.Color accuracy of this display after calibration was also excellent, averaging a delta-e measurement of about 1.2 according to the Spyder4Elite using a 48-point color test.Pros: Good color accuracy and overall picture even without calibration. Pretty much perfect after calibration. Covers 100% SRGB. Nice Matte-display, which isn't grainy looking. Doesn't pick up glare. plenty of inputs. Good stand with pivot, tilt, rotation, and height adjustments. VESA mount compatible.Cons: Lack of any real deep built-in hardware controls to adjust colors and color temperatures.

Great colors, great resolution, no dead pixels, and no weird dust under the screen.I just wish ASUS would make the bezel smaller like they do on the 1080 monitors.The height adjust, swivel & tilt make this a very versatile and easy to use monitor.Just note that if you plan to use it for gaming, you might need a better graphics card from 1080.",3,6,3,9,66.6666666666667,33.3333333333333

I run a GTX970 OC GPU and can push 4K graphics in older games like Skyrim, Left 4 Dead 2, etc, with max settings.  This monitor works great for the games I play, text is very crisp/clear and the video quality is awesome.  I also tried out the Dell 27"" 1440P with G-sync, I went back and forth but ended up keeping the Asus 4K and sent back the Dell (the 30 day return was painless because AMAZON is awesome).  The Asus had a better picture quality and colors were more vibrant and I preferred the larger size screen.  Waiting for the next gen GPUs to come out before upgrading any further, newer games are very demanding in 4K with max settings so you'll need some serious horse power to push it.",1,10,9,11,90.9090909090909,9.09090909090909

I tried to ignore it for sometime, but then I did spend $600 for this monitor so I put a replacement request at amazon. They were the BEST , such an easy and seamless process. The replacement arrived even before I had shipped the older monitor. It was pixel perfect right out of the box , I waited for 30 days to write this review.If you are on the fence about this monitor or 2560X1440 in general ; just go for it. You don't know what you are missing , all the extra pixel goodness is fantastic.

"190","My last G220fb died about a month ago and I had to get something, just to continue on. The PB278Q is a very nice monitor and I am happy with it. Even tho I would have liked to have individual RGB contrast control instead of just gain control, the colors are not that far off in the mid range to be a problem to many or even noticeable for day to day non-photography use. The black is nothing like a CRT, tho it is much better then many other flat panels I've seen.The wide screen format is a bit of a drag when working with many things, even tho it has more pixels then a regular 1080 display. Moving from a 4:3 or 16:10 display to the 16x9 wide screen is very cramping vertically for many things on a computer. Not to say the jog bar at the bottom of many on-line vids obstructs part of the vid on the 16:9 wide screen monitor that was never an issue on taller format displays. Perhaps some day web pages will be better on wide screen displays.For working on stuff, the 1440 height is very nice to have, much better then only 1080 pixels. So over all, without full-screen stuff going, the display is a very nice upgrade from the 1920x1200 B243PWL and a marginal emergency replacement for the dead 2048x1536 G220fb. Yes I am happy with the PB278Q, it will just take some getting use to the lack of vertical real estate.",10,11,1,21,52.3809523809524,47.6190476190476
"191","Solid monitor for the price, beautiful picture and can do 60hz SST.  Normal I buy new but since this was a gaming rig I figured lets try the Amazon Warehouse deal.  The last time I purchased from them it was in original packaging and the monitor was in mint condition.  This time it arrived wrapped in bubble wrap and foam and the screen was gouged.  In addition the stand was damaged and missing the plastic end caps along with the rear cable cover and the display port cable as well.  I ended up buying another but this time made sure it was in the original packaging.  The second one arrived perfect and in very good condition.  As for the monitor, it does have off angle viewing issues, mainly fade due to the TN screen but otherwise if you can buy one for $400 in mint condition it is well worth it.  I have a professional Asus PQ 32 inch 4K on my macpro and that display is amazing.  But for 8x the price it should be.  Glad to see 4K prices are dropping and hopefully a IPS 28-32inch monitor can be had for well under $1000.

"198","Amazing!After using my first 1440p monitor (Auria from Microcenter), I was hooked. This monitor is head and shoulders beyond that Auria monitor which has been relegated to secondary display duties since the new ASUS was installed. I don't do heavy photo work, so I can't judge the accuracy beyond that the monitor looks to be better saturated than my other 1440p but without being over the top. The blacks are also much deeper than my other 1440p screen. It also goes g2g (gray to gray) much faster, resulting in much less screen tearing in gaming while still boasting the same refresh. The latency of the monitor is pretty low for a 1440p screen which is great for gaming as well.The monitor arrived very well packaged, with everything as described inside the box. Upon set up and 15-20 minute inspection with multiple backgrounds I was unable to find any dead or stuck pixels. This is my 8 ASUS monitor purchased between my own computers and family builds, and have yet to receive one with even a single dead pixel.Connectivity is simple with many options to choose from, and the speakers are awful, but who buys a 27"" monitor for the speakers. Stand has many adjustments including 90 degree rotation and tilt, but no swivel. The base is very sturdy and definitely a product highlight for me.I would absolutely recommend this product and everyone that has viewed it in person has loved it.

This monitor fit that bill perfectly, and I could not be happier with the results.

I bought an EVGA GTX 780 6GB card a couple of months ago and it was always in the back of my mind to get a 1440p display. It seems that 1440p is the sweet spot right now for gamers. 4K is too expensive and too brutal on CPUs/GPUs at the moment unless you're going to spend some major cash on an SLI or Crossfire set up.... for mediocre performance at 4K.No matter what site I went to this monitor is the recommended monitor from price to quality. The fact it comes with every single cable is outstanding. Even audio cables. Amazing Asus. 3 year warranty too as well.Amazon packaged the display very well. I was surprised to see an outer Amazon box over the Asus packaged box. Good job Amazon that's why I continue to shop with you. My unit arrived with no dead pixels or backlight bleed. I am very happy about that. The color accuracy is outstanding out of the box. I didn't calibrate anything only thing I did was lower the brightness and it's superb in every way over my other monitor. Text is so crisp and sharp... no artifacts around letters. Colors pop, blacks are black, and it's the perfect blend of a matte/glossy display. Right in the middle... like glossy matte. The stand is very sturdy and feels premium. There's height adjustment, pivot, tilt, and swivel. Tons, of customization in the OSD and real buttons to push on instead of those touch sensitive buttons.I really can't find anything to mention that's worthy of a con. Only thing I guess I could say is there aren't any USB 3.0 ports, but I don't need any lol.

The Asus PB287Q 28"" LED-Lit 4K monitor arrived promptly via my Prime shipping and it worked perfectly/instantly out-of-the-box and after connecting it to my computer.  NO DEAD PIXELS.  NO SLEEP/WAKE ISSUES. This is a fantastic upgrade from my old I-INC 28"" LED that served me well and is still going strong actually, just no backlighting. . . I paid over $700 for that back in 2009 after my Viewsonic 27"" started it's intermittent black-screening, so this 4K 28"" at $560 bucks is a steal to say the least. The base is sturdy and the monitor is very stable as it sits at about half of the total adjustment height.  I also like the menu scheme and setup,, which I never can say,  as it actually depicts the up-down arrows, enter and back functions on screen instead of bezel painted on tiny icons that my eyes can no longer discern.  The minimal personal preference setup was easy and concise.The only con that I can find so far is the illuminated power light mini strip, on the bottom of it, reflecting off of my glass top computer desk.  It is a white led that you can only see from the front if you are already sitting level with the monitor.  I may just cover it with black gorilla tape or permanent marker. . .ha!Best BUY!I will try to update after a few months of a lot of use playing the huge and fantastic looking Dragon Age Inquisition and Call of Duty MW.",4,13,9,17,76.4705882352941,23.5294117647059
"206","This is a fantastic monitor.  I love it.  Just plugged it in and fired it up, basically two cables: HDMI and power.  It all works like a charm, the only adjustment I made was to turn down the brightness just a little.  No issues whatsoever, except for a little lip at the back that makes it slightly challenging to plug in cables.Completely adjustable angles and height - very nice.  That's something Dell doesn't always seem to get.Very clear and sharp.  Bright colors and excellent contrast.I was torn for a while between this and the 4K version, but until Windows 10 comes out for real I think there will be some difficulty with scaling fonts and such for so many pixels, so I saved over a hundred bucks and opted for this model, WQHD is plenty of pixels and although it doesn't quite cover remote-desktop to my 30"" unit at work, it is very close, and a lot better than the 1920x1200 Dell which gets to be a secondary display now.I may eventually regret not going all the way for the 4K monitor, as it is 60hz and all, but with the current state of Windows font scaling it would have bugged me too much to have to use 125% fonts and deal with all the resulting inconsistencies and odd looking panels as a result.  I think 2560x1440 is the best available choice right now unless you want to spend a lot more money for a 30"" monitor, or buy something that's been on the market for 5 years.

As I always do, I purchased a Squaretrade warranty and when they couldn't repair it, they refunded the money and I decided to purchase a brand name monitor with the same resolution at a reasonable price. With Samsung PLS rather than LG IPS technology, this was the only well rated choice at an affordable price without my having to spend at least $100 more for a Dell Monitor.Despite all the positive reviews, I was very concerned I might get a monitor with dead or stuck pixels.The monitor-at the best price available-arrived in two days via Amazon Prime with the excellent manufacturer's packaging in an additional Amazon carton.With trepidation, I took it out of the box, attached the stand in well under a minute with the attached screw, set it on my desktop, chose the HDMI cable to go with my Radeon HD7500 video card (there are also DVI, VGA, Displayport and power cables included!), plugged the hdmi cable into the monitor, turned it on and held my breath while it booted up worried about stuck or dead pixels or back lighting issues. I ran several pixel tests and I was excited to find NO problems and I was delighted to also see that the monitor was pre-calibrated. There is no CD with drivers but I downloaded what was necessary from the Asus site.I watch a lot of foreign movies on the monitor and -for the price-I am very happy with my purchase. At this price point, you can't do any better unless you want to take your chances with a Korean monitor that is not serviceable in this country.Thank you, Amazon and-just in case-get a Squaretrade warranty. Asus has a 3 year warranty but I had a warranty on my Nexus 7 from Asus.

When Amazon had this monitor on sale for about $100 dollars less than the regular price, I bought one.I'm extremely pleased with the purchase. The colors are bright and vivid. The gray to gray response time is plenty good enough for home office and graphics work and fast enough that I don't really notice it while gaming. The WQHD resolution blew me away as I have a rig with enough processing power to drive the display. The only small con to the monitor is a refresh rate of 60 MHz. That leads to some visible strobing effects at times. However, in the price range I was willing to pay, almost all the monitors had the same refresh rate.

In fact, I think I prefer to web browse on the other monitor so that text appears larger.  There are easy workarounds to this, though, such as just control+scroll to zoom website text as appropriate.  I throw windows back and forth between the two monitors too much to hassle with that, though.I primarily use this monitor for playing games, and in that function it really shines.

The colors and vibrancy are absolutely amazing and the sheer size of the 27"" 2k screen is nothing short of glorious. My games look amazing and now I have a ridiculous mount of screen space for my video editing work after upgrading from a 17"" monitor. I am very satisfied with this purchase and highly recommend this monitor, especially to anyone who may be worried about the light bleed (not to say that other's complaints are not valid but just to show that not all of the monitors have this issue)",8,8,0,16,50,50
"221","This monitor is good, not great to me. I've calibrated the color and tinkered around with the settings as much as I can, and it just doesn't look as good as you'd hope it would at the price of $450 (+tax). It's settings and functionality are solid and definitely passible, but the colors and overall video quality aren't quite as vivid as they are on a mac. Good monitor, not great. I'd say save up and get the Thunderbolt personally.EDIT- After using this monitor for about a week and a half, I will say that I am returning it because I am not completely satisfied. It's picture is not as vivid as some others here have described (even after color calibration) and the video does not really look crisp to me. Photo's in LR5 look fine, as does text, but the video element is lacking pretty thoroughly. I'm using a mini display to display cable (that's brand new) and sometimes it takes 20 minutes for this monitor to turn on! It always says ""No Display port Signal"". To me, just save your cash and buy the Thunderbolt, you won't regret it.",2,12,10,14,85.7142857142857,14.2857142857143
"222","I've been using this monitor for about 6 months now...it's great.  I bought it for use in post-processing digital photos in Lightroom and PhotoShop.  It takes and holds calibration, and the display is gorgeous. No ghosting or artifacts, minimal bleed.Incidentally, I'm getting full WQHD (2560 x 1440) resolution through the HDMI port.  I'm actually driving it through an IOGear 4-port HDMI KVM switch (GCS1794)...two Mac Minis, an ASUS Zenbook laptop and a home-built desktop with an NVIDIA GTX650 graphics card (this is my main machine, the one that I use for photo processing, and the reason I bought this monitor).  Note that of the Mac minis, the older one (late 2012 model) won't drive the monitor at more than HD resolution without some software tweaks, while the newer one (late 2014) immediately recognized the WQHD display on the HDMI port and defaulted to 2560x1440 resolution.",1,2,1,3,66.6666666666667,33.3333333333333
"223","This is a great monitor.  I purchased it to go along with my new Intel i5 gaming system.  The price and quality of this monitor were the main factors for my decision to purchase this monitor.The monitor was packaged very well.  The stand is very robust and sturdy.  It's got a very clean and modern look, not too shiny.  I mainly use this monitor for gaming, watching movies, and work.  I use the included Display Port cable which is good enough to support 2560x1440p 60Hz, this monitor's native resolution.  The fact that it's 60 Hz is not a big deal to me.  I'm not a competitive FPS gamer, so I don't need that capability.  When playing games on ultra high settings, I get a consistent 60 FPS with my dual SLI GTX 970s.  I have nothing negative to say about this monitor.  It's an outstanding display for a great price.

"224","UPDATE 3-19-2015-Returned to ASUS for warranty repair shortly after creating this review. Cost was $40 USPS (ohio to California). A week or two past after I shipped it and they received it a replacement was shipped back free of charge. Replacement was brand new in the box. Overall i am going to change my review to 4 (would be 3.5 but no option). Due to the no hassle warranty - though eating shipping is annoyance, and the monitor not lasting very long.. but the screen is brilliant and I do get a brand new monitor without worrying about a possible lemon; so i am happy once more. Fingers crossed on the replacment.Purchased it last october (2014). Ran fine up till today. Turned it on when I got home for work and I have a Purple vertical line running through the monitor vertically. This happened using HDMI input, tried display port input and a laptop.

For dark images it's not that bad, but for light ones, it's really annoying.  I've never seen a monitor with bad pixels before, and two of them together make the defect really stand out.  I even tried one of those programs that turn the pixels on and off for hours at at time to see if they would switch on, but they never did.  The price was right, and the features were what I wanted, but I really doubt that I'd buy another ASUS monitor because of this.  Well, I can't say I wasn't warned--there were plenty of other people who posted problems with dead pixels, but I was hoping I would get lucky.",8,5,-3,13,38.4615384615385,61.5384615384615

"232","Excellent picture, love the size!The only thing I don't like about this monitor is that it's a bit slow to start (~5 seconds from computer wake up, and every time I switch input via a KVM).Also, every time the source is changed (or the monitor is woken up), a big ""ASUS"" message shows up right in the middle of the screen... very annoying, but relatively acceptable as it happens only on source switch or start....I wish ASUS would make the above better though (try to make it faster on source switch, and stop showing a big ""ASUS"" in the middle of the screen!!)",2,6,4,8,75,25

Huge upgrade from my dual 23"" Acer x233h monitors, and running at 3840x2160 is an order of magnitude difference in productivity for me.I haven't had any problems with colours or refresh rates.  I'm not an FPS gamer, but the games that I've tried so far has been lush and gorgeous.  I'm able to have all the usual windows up (three Chrome, one editor, Word, Excel, email, WebEx, multiple file explorers...) and even then the level of clutter is minimal because I have so much more space at the higher resolution.Installation with the VESA mounts was straightforward.  These monitors are not much heavier than my 23"" ones, though they were packaged in overly large boxes.  Since I'm doing dual displays, I use HDMI on one and DisplayPort on the other (limitation of my graphics card) - and they seem to both behave just fine.Super happy. ^_^",2,6,4,8,75,25

The image quality is nice enough for me, but after about a year or so the DisplayPort input has now failed (cannot get any DisplayPort device to work with that input, monitor always thinks nothing is connected), and the monitor occasionally goes black for a few seconds now that I've switched to the DVI input. I'm guessing there's some flaky circuit connection that's the cause of all this, but practically speaking I'm just going to have to replace this thing after a little more than a year.",3,3,0,6,50,50
"236","I love this monitor. I spent a loooong time deliberating whether to go with an Apple Thunderbolt display or this bad boy to compliment my 2014 Macbook Pro. In the end I am really happy I went with this guy. For a fraction of the price, I have a professional quality monitor that is matte, and extremely versatile (swivel/rotate options) and sharp as hell. I'm a static and motion graphic designer so I'm working on the monitor 50-60 hours a week.I'm actually going to get a second one soon to have a pair.No real complaints, the border is a little thick and it might not be a ""sexy"" looking as some higher end monitors in terms of materials for the frame or touch sensor controls, but I'm not worried about that stuff.",6,6,0,12,50,50
"237","Pros: Colors are great.  Picture is crystal clear.  Higher pixel density than 1080 but without the scaling issues from going to 4K on a 27-28"" monitor (things don't look so small that I have to squint to see them).  Monitor is capable of being extremely bright if you need to have it in room that is very well lit or has a lot of outside light coming in.  Games are beautiful.  Not a single dead pixel on 2 of these.  Can adjust height and tilt and swivel.Cons: NoneOverall Thoughts:  I bought 2 of these to replace 2 older 27"" TN panels and was surprised by how much more detail I can see.  I can see when colors on a web page are slightly different from one another now, high quality pictures look better when looking at them, games are sharp and the colors really stand out.  I bought these instead of going 4K because I'd read a lot about scaling issues in Windows 8 with 4K monitors.  I'm glad I did.

"238","I'm a professional 3D rendering artist. I use 3dsMax, Vray and Photoshop every day, so color accuracy is very important to me. I bought this monitor for my home setup. I already had two IPS monitors at work (Dell Ultrasharp), and they are great. Infact, I would rate them higher than this Asus monitor. The only reason I would rate my Dell monitors higher than this Asus is because the colors displayed on the Dell, especially darks and blacks, are much more consistent across the entire width of the screen. The colors on this Asus are very accurate, but there is a noticable, gradient on the bottom-right corner of my screen.My Asus screen also shipped with a cosmetic flaw on the front of the monitor frame. There is a small plastic strip which is not applied properly, so it does not sit flush on one side of my monitor. This really bothered me at first, but it doesn't seem to be getting worse.Overall, I am happy with this purchase.",2,7,5,9,77.7777777777778,22.2222222222222

This represents an additional expense of $80 or $110 for adapter and cable (depending if you opt for the Apple brand adapter or not) It also uses up a USB port on the Air (although there is a USB port on the end of the cable adapter, which is 3 ft long). So far the monitor is working very well and looks great with this connection. There have been no white pixels or snow issues whatsoever.

"246","No bad pixels and very good performance. I needed monitor with a decent color gamut and decent gaming performance. I'm into amateur photography, so I need to order a spectrophotometer to calibrate the monitor, but upon using it for the first time I could tell that the dynamic range and contrast were much better then my old monitor. The trick is to get the calibration close to reality so that when you send a picture to a photo printing service, you will get what you saw on the screen. This monitor is not a pro photographers monitor, but it is better than average and a lot cheaper.The buttons and adjustment menus are hard to use or make sense out of, like a lot of monitors. Some day, the engineers will get it right and create an easy to use system or a way to program the setting from the operating system instead of the buttons. However, out of the box I had little to adjust for immediate use. I needed to turn up the brightness and adjust the color temperature a bit, but not much else.This monitor is connected to a GTX 780 via a displayport cable. In games I have seen no ghosting or shadows. In action/fps games, there is the usual blur that you see with all LCD panels when you rapidly turn, but I expected that. I'm playing at full resolution and I have no complaints. The pixel pitch is so small that anti-alias is really not needed at such a high resolution, it is actually difficult to make out individual pixels unless you have your nose up to the monitor. The color and contrast in the games is very nice, but most people want to know about ghosting and shadowing. I really haven't noticed any. If I played for awhile on CRTs then started using the LCD, I would see the blur difference in the response time for sure, but it is not horrible. If you are used to LCDs, you don't need to worry about playing on one of these. You would have to be a competition level gamer to want better, and you would probably be playing with a lower res 1ms monitor with 60% color gamut.",11,11,0,22,50,50
"247","Big issue with purchasing this monitor - NO Windows 10 drivers for it. You MUST run the windows generic monitor driver. Checked with ASUS and they blame Microsoft, Microsoft blames ASUS.

"248","I finally pulled the trigger and ordered this monitor last week. After a long and grueling quest of sifting through countless review sites and forum posts with opinions on resolution, aspect ratio, refresh rate, why TN panels are better than IPS and vice versa. I'm glad I finally decided on this model.This Asus replaced my old 23"" Acer 1080p monitor. After seeing games in action running at 2560x1440, there's just no going back. Ever. First games I loaded up were Tomb Raider and Hitman Absolution, mostly on high settings. My jaw about fell on the floor. Colors are so vibrant and crisp, blacks are deep and rich, and whites are bright white. The level of detail over 1080 is just astounding. 27"" seems to be the sweet spot for size. There's a lot of real estate for webpages, videos, etc.Build quality is top notch. The stand is very solid, and it's got HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT! The monitor shipped with zero stuck pixels, no ghosting that I've noticed, and very little back light bleed. Back light bleed was pretty low on my priority list anyway. Very rarely am I sitting there just starting at a black screen for hours on end.As of right now, I have not received my GTX 780 in the mail, I should get it next week. I'm currently running an EVGA Classified 448 Core 560TI, overclocked to the max. I'm amazed at how well this card runs most games, even at 1440p. My 1.25gb of VRAM was maxed out on Tomb Raider and Hitman, and I was getting some frame rate issues, clearly in need of a GPU upgrade. Other games like Dishonored, Borderlands 2 and Guild Wars 2 run beautiful. I'd definitely recommend getting a GPU with at least 3gb of VRAM though, with this high of a resolution.If you're on the fence about upgrading to 1440, just do it. You'll be happy you did.",7,20,13,27,74.0740740740741,25.9259259259259

Great way to view my images on a large screen and I'm not broke as a result!",1,3,2,4,75,25
"251","I don't normally write reviews, but because this monitor does not seem to have that many and is only $195 after rebate and before tax, this is definitely worth mentioning. I upgraded from an old Acer X221W which was CCFL backlit with a 1000:1 contrast ratio. So to me, this monitor blows it out of the water. I have never seen colors pop so naturally and text look so sharp. Blacks are very deep, but not enough to muddy up details. Plenty of ports to keep it future proof, and the extra 4 USB ports and speakers are an added bonus.  Also, the fact that this thing is capable of rotating in all 3 axis, and as the ability to adjust height, makes it all the more capable and worth it. The base is also extremely solid as it is completely metal. Also did I mention that this monitor is actually designed for professionals in mind? But for $195, its much cheaper than other competitors such as the Dell UltraSharps, and LG IPS series.No dead pixels is an added bonus. Perhaps I am lucky, compared to some of these other reviews I've seen.The only cons are that the speakers are weak (but what were you expecting....) however, they are much better then a typical laptop's built in speakers. Also, even with IPS the colors do shift somewhat to a cooler temperature when viewed at angles greater than 65 degrees away from center, however sharpness remains intact.If you're looking at other Asus monitors such as the VS239H-P, spend the extra $35 and buy this. It has more ports, is much more adjustable, and has a solid base it's also built from matte plastic which feels much more solid as opposed to the glossy kind found in cheaper monitors. The newer V series monitors from Asus are also notorious for their flimsy stands based on what I have read and cheap glossy plasticy build.",8,17,9,25,68,32

"253","I have four of these monitors - all acquired in 2014.  Of the four two had to be replaced as defective. I have a continuing problem with two of them which is that at power or wake, randomly, they initialize to 1920 X 1200 instead of the correct native 2560 X 1440 resolution. The two that exhibit this problem have an earlier hardware version than the two which which don't. I can tell this, not by part or model number but because of the arrangement of connectors on the back and differences in the on-screen controls.  All four run on Display Port connections.I run them on an AMD Radeon HD 7800 series card with six Display Port outputs (VisionTek HD 7870 Model 900548) on an ASUS Sabertooth Z87 with Intel i7-4770K. Currently on Windows 10, previously on Windows 8.1.It is impossible for me to determine the root cause between Windows, AMD, VisionTek or ASUS. However, the fact that two monitors don't exhibit this problem is a key.  On Windows 8.1, this problem went away with one of the later patches about which Microsoft noted that they had discovered a problem with their video initialization code that impacted only some users. The problem returned with Windows 10 which suggests that this could be some MS problem that somehow was fixed in 8.1 but not in 10.  I have read that some Display Port implementations do have initialization issues.The fact remains however, that the problem is only with the two older monitors and not on the two newer (2014 models) ones.I do not have the bleed problem that many complain about and the image quality is excellent on all four.",14,2,-12,16,12.5,87.5

I normally never buy refurbished products, and I think this is the first time I do it.

Most of poor the reviews here appear to be related to getting a bad copy or lack of features (like USB hub). I don't need additional features and I figured I'd take my chances on getting a good copy. So far, my copy appears to have no pixel issues or consistency problems. The pluses:The picture is absolutely brilliant. I had no ideas my photos were so rich in detailThe monitor is well-calibrated from the factory. My Spyder 4 profiling only changed the calibration slightly (more warm). I actually liked the factory calibration a bit better!The monitor comes with all types of cables (wish I had known before spending the money for a DisplayPort cable)The stand is robust and stableThe minuses:None so far!If you work with photos, this IPS monitor is a very good value IMO.",6,11,5,17,64.7058823529412,35.2941176470588
"259","I upgraded from two Samsung P2450H Monitors to two ASUS PB238Q Monitors.  I had a chance to compare the two brands side by side. The PB238Q's color and contrast are superior. The difference in their corresponding brightness is imperceptible.I can clearly see light bleeding from the background in both lower corners of the PB238Q. The LED power indicator light is causing the brighter background of the two, though it's radius is smaller than the light bleed from the left corner.I don't play a lot of games, but a few now and then. The 6ms refresh time proves to be more than adequate when I play Tomb Raider 2013.The matte finish on the screen looks nice in my dark room, except that the material glows (interior surface of the screen is reflecting or diffusing light). If I look at the screen from 30° off center then I can see a whitish glow covering the entire screen. The farther off center I take the viewing angle, the more visible the glow. I do not notice the glow when I'm sitting at my desk working on the computer viewing at 75-90° angles to both monitors.I was able to install my new monitors onto Ergotron LX desk mount LCD arms without any issue (monitor weight and it's VESA mount are considerations).The price / quality ratio seems fair for this monitor. My upgrade is a definite improvement, and I am satisfied with my purchase.",5,15,10,20,75,25

Colors are sharp - black and white screens (fill screen with either color) look very consistent across the entire field - no hot / dull spots - no color shifts... no pixel drop outsetc.And the price - well its a bunch for a 27 incher - but not for the resolution and its awesome color acutence - check it out - other than the Korean models shipped directly to you with almost guaranteed pixel dropouts (see their fine print) the next closest monitor to this one is Dell's at $125-185 more but offering nothing more in quality or warranty.I'm a happy camper ;-)",4,8,4,12,66.6666666666667,33.3333333333333

But so far I love it... wow!BUT... this is a huge alert to anyone planning to use the DVI connection with a Win 10 environment. In that situation, the monitor does NOT WORK unless you use the special DVI-DL, or DVI ""Dual Link"" cable. One is supplied with the monitor, but I didn't initially use it because its too short, and I was replacing a monitor in an existing installation. My existing cables were DVI-D Single Link cables (check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface for a full education!). They conveyed a digital signal to the previous monitor, and worked fine. When I connected the Asus to this system... NADA. No signal. An intermittant ""Out Of Range"" indication on the screen... then nothing.Worried that I had a dead monitor, I hooked it up to an XP system. It worked GREAT! Now I was really stymied. Another, older DVI monitor still worked great on the Win10 system.Monday came and I called Asus. They too were a bit stumped, and instructed me to test a few things. The second person I talked to then had a hunch that perhaps it was the DVI cable not transmitting essential data to the monitor. While he was expressing that hunch, I hooked in the supplied DVI cable, and... voila!... signal.Summary... great monitor. Easily accessible (at least when I called) support staff; friendly and helpful. And warning. Be careful which DVI cable you use. This monitor will work fine with a single link DVI cable in an XP environment (didn't test Win7 or Win8), but NOT in a Win10 environment. There you MUST use a Dual Link cable.",4,20,16,24,83.3333333333333,16.6666666666667
"264","As the bulk of reviews have indicated, the resolution and color provided by this monitor are astonishing.  I am using it with an Nvidia GTX 570 graphics card.  As some reviewers have noted, the available resolution appears to depend on whether one is using an HDMI 1.4 cable or a DVI cable (both are included with the monitor).  When I connected the monitor to my computer with my old HDMI cable, I could not attain more than 1920x1080 resolution.  However, upon switching to the provided DVI cable, resolution went to 2560x1440 with no further setting changes. The resolution and color are incredible.

I'll make a few comparisons based on that upgrade because I really don't have much else to compare it to.  This Asus monitor has an incredible viewing angle. I'm able to watch movies while sitting on the floor without loosing any of the image like I would with my Samsung monitor.  The resolution is the largest benefit.  The real estate increased five fold.  Also, this monitor is Bright!  The contrast is incredible and the dark colors are deep and vibrant.The only con so far is that the monitor base didn't line up completely with the monitor screen.  It looked crooked and it took some bending of plastic to get it to line up correctly.  I think Asus went cheap on the plastic.  That's why I knocked a star off... it was that annoying that I almost considered returning it.  However, for the price you really can not ask for anything better than this.  If Samsung had a monitor with these features (resolution) that was priced the same I probably would have went with them.",4,10,6,14,71.4285714285714,28.5714285714286

I ordered the second one from Amazon, and it has vertical lines all over the display, as well as pixel inversion problems, and a quick google search revealed that It's a recurring problem.

"267","I bought the monitor less than a month ago for business and charting use, i chose this monitor for its flexible stand and medium sized screen real estate . Out of the box the screen was too bright and the colors were off, almost as if all the colors had a yellow tint to them, this was easily fixed by going into the monitor menu and changing preferences to my liking. After all the modifications the screen looked amazing all colors were perfect and the monitor had great resolution, i was satisfied. This however changed as one night after use i left the monitor open with a charting page displaying on the screen. The monitor flickered with lines running up and down the screen and the charting page permanently appeared on screen even though it had been closed, this was only after 2 days of use. I did the logical thing which was check my connections(HDMI), turn on and off, disconnect from outlet, download any drivers from ASUS, reset all settings, and gave it time to rest to make sure it was cooled off in case it had over heated , NOTHING worked. As i was preparing to ship it back the screen slowly started to come back, the charting page image was slowly disappearing and the monitor flicker less and less, after about an hour the screen had returned to its glory and it has stayed working for about a week now.

I use it for work (multiple windows, large spreadsheets) and gaming (adventure games).  Picture quality exceeds my expectations.I was apprehensive about the quality issues that other reviewers mentioned, but decided to take a chance and got this instead of the BenQ BL3200PT (which seemed to have fewer complaints) since I liked the design and features much better.  Looks like I got lucky -- perfect in all respects, and no dead / stuck pixels after 1 month of use and 96 hrs of pixel cycling [Guillaume Dargaud's Dead Pixels Test].  I used the dead pixel checker on that website (free) and checked the screen with a magnifying glass.  LOL  Also checked all of the ports and they work perfectly.  The 4 additional USB ports are very handy.I'm keeping my fingers crossed that no dead pixels will show up later as some others have mentioned.

It makes you think your computer has failed.Update:  This has only happened twice in the time I've owned it.  Given how nice it looks I've upped it to 4 stars.

I wanted to replace it earlier but I couldn’t find an affordable/acceptable 27” replacement. Either the cost was too high or the resolution/contrast was insufficient. I’ve have enjoyed this monitor nearly 3 years now. It was trivial to setup and has been operating flawlessly since. The picture is awesome (in native mode) with crisp text and a large desktop.

I think the limiting factor right now might be my video card.  Also, a lot of images are not 2K so they are not as amazing when viewed ""fitted to the screen"".

"277","Who’s it useful for?If you are a computer gamer, and want bright, vivid colors on a large, high resolution screen, then this is the monitor for you. Gaming on this monitor has been almost all positive. The bright colors combined with the amazing viewing angles that the IPS screen offers are truly a joy to look at. The only downside for gaming is the 60hz refresh rate. If you want a higher framerate at the cost of amazing contrast and vivid colors, then this might not be the monitor for you, but for the casual gamer it is amazing.Photography/video professionals will also love this monitor. The high contrast combined with the real-to-life color replication make this one of the best monitors out there for video and photo editing.The average movie/Netflix/YouTube watcher will also love the high definition and contrast that comes with this monitor.Evaluation Criteria and My AssessmentI evaluated this monitor on a few criteria: price, viewing experience, and build quality.1. Price: The monitor was on the more expensive side. The main reason that this monitor has the price tag that it does is because of its high 1440p resolution and IPS screen. The price was justified to me because I will be using it on an $1100 gaming computer.2. Viewing Experience: The viewing experience of this monitor is absolutely amazing. The high resolution makes everything on the screen look amazingly clear. The IPS panel has 178 degree viewing angles so you can view it from anywhere in the room without loss of color and brightness. The other advantage of having an IPS panel is having amazing contrast and true to life color replication, both of which are absolutely stunning on this monitor.3. Build Quality: The build quality of this monitor appears to be of a very high level. The stand that comes with the monitor is extremely solid and has no wiggle at all. The fact that the screen can rotate to portrait mode on the OEM stand is great. The downside of having such a sturdily built monitor is the weight. This monitor with the stand is very heavy, despite being pretty thin.Ending ThoughtsMy overall experience with this monitor has been extremely positive. Everything I watch on it looks amazing, and the only two slight downsides are the weight of the monitor and the fact that it is only 60hz, both of which are only slight downsides for me.5/5 stars from me.",6,24,18,30,80,20

Lots of users are experiencing problems where the computer will not wake up when connected via DisplayPort. The only solution I've found that *sometimes* works is to pull DP cable AND the power cable from the monitor, and then replug them in. This is very annoying.

"283","I've only had this a few days and my primary use is to set up for dual displays for programming. In that mode, I really do want that 90-degree rotation, and that's where the problem is. In the ""normal"" orientation, the screen looks great, illumination is very even across the whole screen, shifting my head left and right has little or no impact of how colors appear. However, when rotated 90-degrees, that's not true. The viewing angle in this mode is much more restricted. You can actually see the same thing when unrotated. Tilting the monitor down results in the bottom of the screen appearing faded. Tilting it up has more leeway. The main point here being that you have a fairly limited range of viewing positions when the monitor is rotated 90-degrees. I'm not sure that this peculiar to this monitor; probably not. But it's not mentioned on the specifications anywhere that I can find what the viewing angle range is when rotated.

"286","I was originally torn between getting a 4K (3840 x 2160) monitor, or a 27-Inch WQHD IPS (2560 x 1440).  My intended use is mainly graphics and business work (no gaming), so getting a good monitor with faithful color reproduction and wide viewing angles is extremely important.  Given my price range, it came down to choosing between this monitor with a TN panel instead of an IPS panel.  I decided that the benefit of this monitor's  extra resolution would have a far greater impact than the color accuracy of the IPS model, so I ordered this as an external monitor for my MacBook Pro.  Overall I'm very pleased with my choice, as I'm currently driving this monitor and a 24 inch Dell IPS UltraSharp and I like this one better.  It would be nice if the color reproduction was as good as the Dell's, but you'd end up paying well over double for a display like that.  The Dell is also 1920x1200 whereas this is only 1920x1080, but that's also a minor point.  Even though this is a TN panel instead of an IPS, the viewing angles are very good - far better than the last TN-based monitor that I had years ago.  The picture on this is sharp, clear, and everything is big and easy to read given the 28 inch size.  It worked perfectly with my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013), and a single DisplayPort 1.2 cable is all you need for both video and audio connections.  The built-in speakers aren't great, of course, but they're probably better than your average laptop's speakers and it's nice to have the audio positionally synced with the video.  The display has a lot of features, including color modes, and I was able to get it to match perfectly with the Dell.

I am just used to an Apple Thunderbolt Display which doesn't have these problems at all. It is $1000 more expensive though and now I see why.

"300","I'll update this later when I get to use it some. Right off the bat I'm annoyed to find out OS X won't allow me to change HDMI volume from the OS; instead I have to change it on the monitor. Not a big deal with the nicely labeled volume shortcuts shown in the picture, right? Unfortunately, the model I received has 6 dots instead of the logos shown in the Amazon description. Pressing any dot brings up a menu where some of the buttons then immediately do something. Out of the box it's configured to have brightness and ""splendid"" as its shortcuts--no volume. To select volume I had to press any button, press the menu button, navigate to sound, navigate to volume, and then I could change the volume. I found the shortcut setting so now it's a three-step process: press any button, press the button for volume, then change the volume. All-in-all it's the kind of thing that makes me wonder if ASUS had any humans test the product before sending it out the door. Why have a clearly labeled, instant-access volume button you can learn to find with your eyes closed when instead we can make it a multi-step process where you have to focus carefully to do what you want?On the plus side, there are no dead pixels, and the monitor is running nicely at 2560x1440 in Yosemite.",4,7,3,11,63.6363636363636,36.3636363636364

The only thing I hate about this are the buttons at the back. Who thought that putting buttons at the back was a good idea?I bought this monitor at amazon warehouse deal for super cheap. It came in its original box and it looked brand new. Everything was inside.So I`m running this monitor at 4k @ 60hz and it runs fantastic. I have a gtx 980ti with i7 4790k CPU and 8gb ram. I play new games at 60FPS smooth. I was really scared about people saying the input lag in this monitor sucks. LOL. Really??Unless you have bionic eyes or something, you wont even notice anything. I don`t play FPS game for a living so for me I can`t notice anything about input lag, my games run just fine.Are you concern about playing at 1440p on this display? DON`T be. Running games at 1440p looks super good, nothing like what people were saying in forums like ""Oh you`d have blurry image if you play at 1440p on 4k.

Very secure, tons of adjustment, very well put-together.Con-Dead pixel after two days. ASUS won't replace for just one dead pixel. Really, really annoying. Fortunately it's all the way in one corner, and with the 1440p resolution it's almost invisible 95% of the time.-Occasionally gets 'snow' (flickering white pixels) in the center of the screen. Not sure what triggers them, but they're usually there and gone before I start trying to figure it out anyway, so it's not the biggest pain.

One note, be sure to have a good graphics card (and fast computer) for this monitor or you won't get the max resolution and speed.

"309","This monitor has a great picture, with good color that is consistent from a variety of viewing angles.What it sucks at is handling multiple computers.  I use a PC and Mac together and switch between them frequently.  This works fine in most situations, but it doesn't work so well in certain others.The problem is that the monitor has automatic input selection, which means that if one input goes away then the monitor scans and switches to any other input that's still active, and that feature can not be disabled.  This sucks when you're just doing something as basic as restarting a computer, as the monitor will switch to the other computer instead, causing the startup screen to go by unseen.  Switching back right away to watch startup logs isn't possible either because while the monitor is showing the graphic in the upper left corner announcing the input it switched itself to, the buttons are all disabled until that info badge goes away.The other time it becomes a problem is when I'm switching to the computer that's currently off in order to turn it on.  I have to be very careful to switch my keyboard first, bring up the second computer and wait until its video is (hopefully) active before I switch the monitor to it, otherwise the monitor will just switch itself back to the first computer.I wouldn't mind any of this if I could turn off the automatic switching, but there is no option for doing that -- it's always on.I'm still giving the monitor four stars because the picture is great and that's the single-most important thing and because I realize most people don't use multiple computers at once.  If you do use multiple computers you may want to consider an external A<->B box instead of relying on the monitor to change inputs for you.",6,11,5,17,64.7058823529412,35.2941176470588

Oh well.  It's just that good.  I am LOVING it.One helpful tip:  The display comes set with a default of 100% brightness.  That's way too bright unless you're working on the sun itself.  I had to set my brightness down to 35% for best quality.  Don't forget to do that.

Just from a productivity standpoint, if your eyes work fine, then you will love having the extra screen space. Having 4+ windows open at a time and viewable is definitely awesome. It is also great that this monitor is actually capable of 60hz, as opposed to other cheap 4k monitors that only run at 30hz. If you're going to be gaming and you want 4k on a budget, this is the monitor for you.Only con is that it is a TN panel and the colors aren't the most vibrant, but it was plenty good for a non-photo editor like me.10/10",1,13,12,14,92.8571428571429,7.14285714285714

It's absolutely effective in gaming as well. With a 4k screen I can run the talos princible on max minus SSAO at a solid 60fps, using a 970.

Unfortunately with dark displays (aka a black screen, etc.) this display exhibits very noticeable ""backlight bleeding"" along most of the left-hand side of the screen and ""backlight bleeding"" at the lower half of the right-hand side of the screen. I was prepared to return this monitor and request a replacement until I searched the internet and discovered this is a common problem with these flat screen displays, a problem that did not exist on the 24"" 1920x1200 IPS monitor this monitor replaced. That said, I decided to live with this problem as there would be no guarantee a replacement would fix this problem and probably about a 50-50 chance that the replacement monitor might have ""backlight bleeding"" that's even worse.From what I've read about ""backlight bleeding"" the problem occurs because white light from the back lighting source (LEDs for this monitor) bleeds/reflects around where the edges of the display meet the monitor's bezel edges. In most cases the problem can be fixed by adhering black electrical tape along the display edges. But this means disassembling the monitor, separating the screen from the monitor's bezel to apply the black electrical tape and reassembling it again, which would definitely void the monitor's warranty.ASUS is known for their high quality, high performance motherboards and I've been a loyal ASUS motherboard user for years.

"328","Definitely met my expectations!! Loving 4k so much more detail is available.  I'm still fairly new to 4k tv's/monitors so im learning as i go.  4k worked great once I figured out that I needed to use a display port cable in order to utilize the 60hz range. I was using a 4k ready hdmi cable but for some reason It would only display in 4k at 30hz.  Found some posts that suggested a display port cable would have to be used in order to access the 60hz range.  Sure enouhg went out cot a DP cable and presto chango!! 60 hz 4k! looks simply awesome.  Now the only thing i have to figure out is how to adjust mouse sensativity to be more like what i was used to on the 1080 screens.  For some reason the mouse doesn't quite feel right when on the 4k setting..but that has nothing to do with the monitor and more to do with system trying to function with a monitor that has a higher capacity than its use to. I managed to adjust the scroll speed so it does feel better now.. but not quite a hundred percent.

Beautiful picture quality and vibrant colors, especially in comparison to a few years old 1080p LED monitor that I've been using. Every once in a while the display port signal would cut out and an abrupt static sound would emanate from the monitor, eventually picking up the signal again after a few seconds.Two months in the first issue happened. A very thin but noticeable vertical line all the way from the top of the screen to the bottom had appeared after turning on the monitor. The unit was serviced and upon return the issue was fixed but another one had appeared in its place. This time a large cluster of stuck (red, green, blue) pixels appeared on the left side of the screen.  In addition the display port finally gave out, simply displaying the standard ""No display port signal"".

"330","The picture on this monitor is a definite 5 star, but I'm concerned about the long term quality. I have no back light bleed and had zero dead pixels when it arrived. After about 3 months, a small gray spot appeared. It doesn't look like dead pixels - it looks like a little dust behind the screen because it almost looks like a tiny shadow being cast from the inside. It is only visible on a white image and I use Autocad all day which has a black background so I don't typically see it. Looking at web pages it occasionally catches my eye, but I figured I just had to live with it. Then about 3 months after that, a second similar spot appeared in a different area. So now the monitor is 9 months old and I have 2 gray spots. Hopefully I will not get more because this is not covered under the replacement warranty (you need a ""constant on"" pixel or 3 dead pixels for that).

If you have the screen on without something driving it, you can see the corners light up a bit but it has not impacted my applications or visibility in any way.

I have a port replicator but use a thunderbolt displayport plug in directly to my laptop for this and extend the remaining monitors off the replicator.If there was an issue with the light bleed, I'm not seeing it on this unit.",4,3,-1,7,42.8571428571429,57.1428571428571
"334","I use this monitor for Photoshop, Premiere, and Revit as well as a couple game titles. I’m very satisfied with the 100% RGB color configuration, the colors are very vivid. At 300cd the brightness is adequate. I often dim the screen at night and never brighten the screen to max. The stand is excellent, very durable, can tilt, raise and lower as well as turn the screen from landscape to portrait when editing large format portrait designs. At 60Hz you have to sacrifice motion blur if you play fast motion games but the 1440p is worth it over a 1080p 120Hz. The button controls are well placed on the bottom right. The large real estate is great for multitasking multiple windows. My only complaint is the placement of the power cord connection on the bottom because every month gravity does it toll and I have to push it back up when I think my screen died on me.For a while I was skeptical about purchasing a Korean brand WQHD high resolution screen for the extremely low prices. In the end I choose against it because I wouldn’t be patient enough to hassle with RMA’ing a screen if it had defects even if I ordered a picture perfect. It seems hit or miss for people. I wanted a higher than 1080p resolution screen much like the Apple Cinema screens. Originally I wanted a glass screen but after some considerations on monitor placement with the huge amount of light coming into my entertainment room I decided that the glass and glossy screens would not be a suitable option due to glare. It may not be 2160p or 1600p but it’s a very noticeable improvement over 1080p, so much so that I have to upgrade my 1080p TV now. I won’t touch a 2160p until there’s an affordable and reliable IPS at 60Hz.Asus provides all the cables you need. A warning though, you need a motherboard and graphics card that supports high resolution screens. Asus Z87/Z97 motherboards are great and support up to 4k. You need at least a NVidia GTX 760 graphics card to support up to 4k. If you’re an extreme gamer or want better performance and higher frame rates get at a 770, 780 or 780ti. Not sure which AMD’s support up to 4k.",11,27,16,38,71.0526315789474,28.9473684210526

In order to get the full 4K resolution, I had to connect it via the HDMI port on the MBP.  Mini displayport to displayport wouldn't work, whether from the second Thunderbolt port on the MBP, or when trying to daisy chain it off of the thunderbolt port on the Apple monitor.  To be certain it wasn't some setting or a cable I was using, I contacted Apple Support and they were the one that told me the only way to get the full 4K in my particular setup was via the HDMI port on the MBP.  Because the MBP is docked in a (vertical) Henge Dock, I even tried a Thunderbolt/Mini displayport to HDMI adapter rather than the HDMI port on the MPB itself in order to try to avoid having the HDMI cable plugged into the top of the MBP, but that wouldn't display at any resolution on the ASUS 4K monitor.  The ASUS monitor did support the thunderbolt/mini displayport to displayport IF the Apple thunderbolt monitor was NOT attached, but it (assuming it was a limitation of the Mac hardware/software) would not drive two ""displayport"" monitors at high resolution",1,7,6,8,87.5,12.5

Menu on ASUS is much easier to work with and intuitive.1st:  The buttons on the Asus there are 7 buttons to customize and adjust your monitor AOC has 5.  Two extra make it easier to adjust.

"346","I was looking to buy a bigger monitor then my old 2407wfp 24"" Dell. I have been very happy with my Dell since buying it way back in 2006. I just wanted a bigger screen. 30"" screens look great but most cost over 1000. I started to look at 27"" screens and considered the Dell U2713HM and the Asus PA279Q both are more expensive. After looking at reviews and watching youtube reviews off all 3 I decided that I would get the Asus PB278Q. I can't say how this compares to those but I really like my PB278Q.Compared to the Dell (2407WFP) the screen is 3"" wider and only .5 inch taller. So not a world of difference in screen size. The Dell (2407WFP) being 16:10 and the Asus being 16:9. Maybe not the world of difference that I was expecting but still a very nice monitor and I have been very happy with it.I found one dead pixel and it really is hard to find most of the time. Even on a white screen I have to really look to find it. while playing games I never notice it. I have only played Empire total war, Sins of a solar empire and Civ V. I have not spent much time playing BF4 so far to give it a real review.I bought the MSI R9 290 Gaming card to use with this monitor replacing my old HD5850. Seems to be able to run the monitor just fine.The monitors build quality is great. It has a very stable stand. So if your in the market for a 27"" monitor you might be able to get a more expensive monitor but would the price difference be worth the money.

"347","Good monitor. I am using it with 2x NVidia GTX 970 in SLI at this time and read in advance that you need to change to DisplayPort 1.2 in the settings to get 60Hz, so I did that and it worked fine. Windows 8.1 scaling works very well. I did not have to play with fonts, icon sizes, etc.I also dual boot Fedora. I had to add some settings to the xorg.conf to get 60 Hz, but nothing a little googling couldn't help me find, though scaling fonts and icons was more of an issue and I had to do considerable googling to not go blind, but I was able to get Xfce working just fine and I saw much documentation for GNOME as well.The only nuisance with this thing is that I used to use the power saving mode on my APC UPS to shut off my monitor when I sleep or shut down my PC. I found that the monitor was going blank and saying that there was no Display Port signal, especially when booting into Fedora. It also takes so long to for the thing to power up and get the actual display that my PC was well past grub and booting by the time I could see anything. So I now power the monitor on and off separately and make sure it's on before I start my PC, which is a little lame, but not bad once you get used to it. Fix that and I'll give it 5 stars.",5,7,2,12,58.3333333333333,41.6666666666667

My first impression was five stars. However, I soon noticed that the colors were darker at the top of the screen and then washed out towards the bottom of the screen. Overall, display tends to be a bit milky and washed out at most angles.

Maybe most customers won't notice but as a former Art student and current videophile, I noticed this right away and knew something was off.1st) Extremely noticeable uniformity issue: the right side was way cool and the left side was warm .2nd) The monitor was splotchy, an noticeable warm on the bottom left where my Start button is.3rd) The whole bottom of the monitor had this warm zone.  moving white windows into it you can see the defect loud and clear.4th) Just about perfect uniformity.  No noticeable issues.  Perfect.Asus usually makes extremely well made hardware.  My Mobo and Router are both Asus.  I'm usually a very satisfied Asus customer; but in terms of monitors I question their Q/A department.Thanks to Amazon's awesome return policy I was able to cycle through the monitors seamlessly until I got one that wasn't defected.If you have issues returning it a 3rd time for a replacement, you will have to talk to a representative because after 3 consecutive returns an andon cord gets pulled on Amazon's replacement system.Just keep that in mind if you decide to cycle until you get one that's perfect.4/5 because of the amount of times I had to cycle through monitors.off the books, 5/5 i love this monitor!",7,17,10,24,70.8333333333333,29.1666666666667

I cannot compare it to the more expensive monitors which I have never used, but for me this monitor is perfect and I have not regretted my purchase. Added bonuses are that the monitor stand allows the monitor to be raised and lowered and even turned to portrait mode and and also that every potentially useful cable is included.

The display on the Mac was beautiful, so I wanted to use the same technology on the PC.  The Mac uses an IPS display, and this ASUS uses similar technology (if not exactly IPS, an offshoot).  Reviews here sealed the deal.This monitor is a sight to behold.  I mostly game on it, and the colors really pop in everything I've thrown at it.  There is very very very slight lag, but unless you're a full on FPS pro the picture quality more than makes up for it.  I was initially worried that it wasn't full gloss, but the matte is fairly slight and doesn't seem to hinder the pic quality.",4,2,-2,6,33.3333333333333,66.6666666666667
"370","I've used this monitor for about 2 years now. My favorite feature is the very solid stand that allows the monitor to be tiled 90 degrees. This is great in multi monitor setups for viewing long documents, write code, and other applications that benefit from very long vertical resolution. It would be even better if the bezel was thinner. With 2 side by side, the bezel is significant. The very first monitor I purchased had back-light bleed that was kinda noticeable when viewing darker stuff. A button also died. However, ASUS's rapid replacement promptly sent out replacement and I didn't have to go without a monitor. Port options are plentiful, with pretty much all that you can ask for in a monitor. Although with a price premium over many 23inch IPS monitors, a USB 3.0 hub instead of 2.0 would have been very much appreciated.",3,12,9,15,80,20

IPS once you are used to the brightness and calibrate it well, makes it very hard to go back to TN and TF panels. 1440p is now the minimum resolution I would consider using on a desktop monitor. Asus build quality is top tier, with good materials well-fitted. This monitor will not be the cutting edge for gaming, as it's response time and average refresh rate simply don't match up with the 144hz displays that really provide the best experience in games today, but it's resolution and color reproduction is very solid.",1,7,6,8,87.5,12.5

"376","This is a great monitor for the money.  There's two things I especially like about it: the IPS screen and the great stand.Let's start with the screen.  It is nice and bright, and has a nice matte finish that doesn't glare.  I have a Lenovo Thinkpad W520 which also has a beautiful IPS screen, and my hope was to find an affordable 2nd monitor to use alongside it.  This is about ""95% there"", in other words, ""plenty good!""And then there is the stand!  You can raise, lower and tilt this thing to your heart's content!  I often put a webcam on top of it for Google Hangouts and Skype calls, and you can raise/ lower and swivel the thing so the camera is at eye level and has the optimal background.  I really can't say enough good things about this feature.  I just wish ALL external monitors came with this stand!Anyway, buy this thing!  You won't regret it.",3,12,9,15,80,20
"377","Only had two issues.1. There was an intense amount of back light bleed coming from the bottom left corner of the screen, about a 5"" x 5"" area. I could press on the anti-glare cover and the back light bleed would go away. So it seemed as if the cover was not flat on the panel. So I cut a piece of plastic from one of the included DVI covers into a small L shape and stuck it in the corner, which removed almost all of the back light bleed in that area.2. This is a design flaw and really only affects people who mess with it a lot, which I do, several times a week. The DVI, and other, ports on the back of the monitor come out vertical, instead of horizontal out of the back like other monitors, and you really have to bend the cables hard. If you are using a DVI cable, then there is almost no room to tighten the screws and require a lot of wiggling and takes multiple attempts to get the threads started.Other than these issues, it's a perfect monitor.I do also have to say that the stand is AMAZING.",10,3,-7,13,23.0769230769231,76.9230769230769

Now I have a monitor that equals the other stuff.This Asus monitor is simply stunning. In particular, fine details in my photos that I've never seen on other monitors have simply opened up. Not simply the sharpness, which is unparalleled, but the tonal values really open up too. Hard to describe. And vivid colors.One caveat, the default color settings were not what I would like. I use a Spyder Pro calibration system, which is ESSENTIAL if you are serious about photography. I ran it once and it brought the color rendition of the monitor into perfect spec. If you use the tools Microsoft provides for color fidelity you will likely be vastly disappointed.I read somewhere (probably Cnet) that this monitor is at the low end of professional graphics monitors. I cannot imagine I'd ever need anything better, and I'm pretty picky.Make sure your graphics card will support the resolution, mine did.

If you have an i2 or Spider colorimeter it is still worth a calibration to account for your environment but the changes will be minor.The resolution is perfect for its size, any higher and it would make text and type to tiny (Expanding text is OS is always problematic). If there was a 32"" version with the same resolution that would have been slightly better.  I would stay away from 4K displays on anything less than 40"".Ergonomics are quite good but could do with about 1"" extra hight to allow easy switch between landscape and portrait mode.Overall very very happy, grab one while they are still available.

"391","I bought this specifically for Photo Editing.As a first time IPS owner this monitor was an eye opener, after a quick calibration i did a side by side test with my Alienware OptX 120hz monitor (I use it for gaming) I always thought the colors were really good on the alienware, boy I was wrong. The difference is night and day. Color is outstanding.The one thing I miss is the ability to pan the monitor left and right, not a big deal at all, but the OptX I own does this, and I love that feature. This monitor does however go into portrait mode (although exagerated due to the 16:9 aspect ratio), very nice feature.Build quality is adequate. The base is plastic but weighted well enough, I dont see this being an issue down the road. If you want better build quality I would look into the Dell IPS, it costs more but they have sales for it all the time.My panel came with no inconsistent light bleed, but true blacks arent very black, even when calibrated. The contrast is fine, but true blacks are too washed out with backlight.the input lag from mouse to screen is quite noticeable. It actually affected my productivity but after a few weeks I started getting used to it.The resolution is such a luxury I feel like it's overkill sometimes. It makes 1920x1080 feel cramped when i drag windows to my alienware monitor. For photo editing it's been great for seeing details without pixel peeping. For web browsing I zoom the pages so I can read the text. (control + scroll).Ghosting is noticeable during games (smearing of text/images) but it's not terrible. Movies still look great, but gaming is not enjoyable on this monitor for me due to the ghosting and the input lag previously mentioned.Everything I reviewed is perfectly normal for IPS panels of this price range.

Setup was a breeze and I got full resolution out of the box, and 60Hz with my Mid-2014 MacBook Pro with DisplayPort 1.2 (via a menu change).There is a VERY noticeable 1/2"" area of black shading at the bottom of the display. SHAME on you ASUS QC!For those of you who care about the anti-glare coating, it is VERY noticeable and not something that you can overlook if this is something that is important to you.And WHY put the buttons in the back? They're low profile. Put them on the bottom where I can visually align my finger placement to the button I'm supposed to click. It's like they forgot to test this design with an actual designer.If you are looking for 4K/60Hz in an affordable price range, and don't care about the anti-glare coating, and can tolerate the dice-roll for QC, this is an affordably priced monitor that is excellent in all other respects.I absolutely cannot recommend this monitor for designers.",2,8,6,10,80,20

Some monitors I've used in the past had overly bright whites or were just not as vibrant but this monitor has none of those issues. Even with the blue filter it has you can still see blues in a crisp manner without any distortion.After almost three months of having this monitor I can say that I have zero complaints about it. For the price and quality this is perhaps the best 4K monitor out there. Currently with the price of 32"" monitors you could buy almost three of these for the same price of a single 32"" so why even bother with them. The bezel is very small and you can easily run dual or triple monitor setups without loosing a lot of space to the thick bezels other monitors have.I had this monitor out of the box, VESA mounted, and running in just a couple minutes. About half of that time was spend admiring the monitor itself and unmounting my old monitor so this is very quick to get out of the package and start using right away.

"397","This is a negative review for Asus changing their product without telling the consumer.  I expected to receive the monitor shown on the Amazon and Asus website, but Amazon appears to be shipping the PB278QR, or perhaps the PB278Q with the PB278QR On Screen Display & frame (my monitor version number is PB278Q with a manufacturing date of Jun 2014).  The PB278QR uses a different OSD than the PB278Q, which doesn't include User Mode.  Instead you get: Scenery Mode, Standard Mode, Theater Mode, Game Mode, Night View Mode, & sRGB Mode.  The monitor frame also has different icons above the buttons; you now get non-descriptive ""dots"" instead of picture icons above the menu buttons.I returned my first monitor, thinking that it was a manufacturing error, but the replacement monitor was exactly the same.  After wasting a bunch of time doing research, I finally found the PB278QR on the Asus website:  http://www.asus.com/Monitors_Projectors/PB278QR/overview/.  The PB278QR instruction manual matches the monitor I received.  I can't find any reviews on the PB278QR, and I'm not even sure that's what I have --- maybe it's just a PB278Q in PB278QR clothing.

"398","Bought two of these babies, they are beautiful. Despite being TN panels they are bright enough and the color gamut is lively enough to be easily viewed even though I have them positioned with a window directly behind them. The stand is fantastic, especially when you compare them to the Dell or Samsung offerings with the same panel. The extras are great and the 60Hz over Display Port puts this one above the competition though to get it to work you will have to navigate the menu (it is easy to navigate) and activate it and you may have to update a graphics driver. Having the equivalent of four 1080p screens per monitor is great for working on multiple documents and drawings while being able to monitor websites, email and social media. For UHD gaming this is the monitor of choice if you've got the graphics muscle to push the pixels. The screens are very responsive though Gaming mode hasn't made any noticeable difference in FPS, FPRPG, Action, Fighting, Simulation or Strategy. I tried these two out in Eyefinity but even with my high end crossfire setup it is a wee bit too much to handle effectively. Colors are almost good enough for professional photo/video editing/content creation but is certainly good enough for amateur/home efforts. The wide (for TN) viewing angles were a pleasant surprise as well. They are fantastic for drafting and other CAD type applications. The speakers are functional but nothing to write home about, though if you are an audiophile you're probably not planning on using them anyway.

If you are going to make a monitor where there is a high probability that the users may have two or more monitors on their desk, then make it flexible platform for the base so that the monitor can swivel and/or make the base semi-circular.  What engineers designed this mechanical structure? - - They should look to Dell for inspiration - I have had the Dell 30in monitor and the base is so well designed and it practically takes up no space and swivels perfectly.

It has 2 USB ports on the left and 2 on the bottom. It has speakers which I don't use but I tested them and they are decent. A Logitech c920 webcam fits fine on top of this monitor. The button placement is very good on this monitor, as apposed to most monitors where buttons are on the button and nearly impossible to press without using two hands because the monitor will move.Great for movies and gaming, I play Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory at 1920x1080 and I must say it's a very nice improvement from a 1680x1050 resolution I had with my previous monitor (Samsung SyncMaster 226BW). In general the resolution upgrade is great because of the work I do which commonly takes up the entire desktop. The colors look amazing, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this monitor.

The refresh rate is just fine, way better then the previous 4k monitor I was using that refreshed at 30Hz.

"417","Did a lot of research on monitors and finally decided on this one. Was a little more than I wanted to spend, but less than I budgeted so I was content.It arrived well packaged, and the stand was something to behold. There were pictures, but those don't do it justice... this is one of the best monitor stands I had ever used. Even the base of it is useful, I have my desk mic sitting on it, and my speaker hub. Its flat, its solid, and the rubber feet keep it in place.The monitor itself is quite nice, visually speaking. Very crisp, I cannot make out individual pixels on it like I can on my other monitors. The colors are a bit more blue than I am used to, but I think that is more to do with my older monitors (both TN pannels) that seem to have a slightly yellowish pall to it no matter how you set the color. Contrast is excellent, so very sharp and not an smudge of blurring.The USB hub built in to it allowed me to at last get rid of the horrid USB hub I've been using for so long... neither my keyboard nor my mouse could reach the computer on the floor, so this has been a godsend!My only complaint is the fact that its so freaking wide. I had hoped to turn it to portrait mode for programming and writing... but its so wide I can't reasonably use it that way. It ends up tall enough to strain my neck.

"421","EDIT 2016-01-21:I requested a replacement unit from Amazon, and received it two days later (today). So far the replacement exhibits none of the pixel line issues that plagued my original unit. There appear to be settings in the OSD menu that were not there before (although I won't swear to that) so it could be a newer unit (or new firmware of some sort?). At this rate I'll bump my rating up to 4 stars since its a good monitor for a decent price.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I did a lot of research before purchasing this monitor, and it would overall be a great display - ergonomics are good, display is bright, response is perfectly acceptable, price is decent, lots of various inputs, etc etc.However my unit has very faint, but clearly visible ""pixel"" lines across the entire display. On black they appear as faint red lines between the black pixels (pic on left). My other monitor (an older Planar 27"") does not have such artifacts (pic on right), neither do any of the 24"" and various smaller displays I own.  I've changed the cables, changed computers, changed video cards, drivers, changed modes and various settings on the monitor itself. Turning off ASCR and increasing the brightness helps to an extent, but its always noticeable - and the longer you use it the more noticeable it is.Has anyone else noticed anything similar? Is this normal for this monitor, or did I just luck out and get a lemon? I was planning on getting another unit (so I had a matching pair) to replace my older monitor, but the lines are driving me nuts and I'm closer to returning this one than considering another purchase at this point.Pic on left is ASUS, pic on right is another monitor (without the issue).",6,11,5,17,64.7058823529412,35.2941176470588

I wanted something nice, but I didn't want to break the bank so I started researching. I'm a slow buyer so after about a week I was pretty sure this was the one I was going to get. As a last check, I called my brother to ask for his opinion. He is a graphic artist and a monitor nut (he has 5). As soon as sent it to him, he replied ""I already bought that and loved it so much I ordered 2 more.""It's now been about 5 months and I still am startled at how bright and clear everything on my screen is.

It feels fairly sturdy, looks really good, and the display quality is very good for the price.Pros:* It's big!* Decent color, a bit on the cool side, but nothing to complain about.* Display is sharp. All those pixels... so many pixels...* Can rotate from horizontal to vertical orientation* It's really big!* Light weight.* Good price.* Did I mention it's big?Cons:* Cable connections are a bit awkward to get to, but that seems to be epidemic these days (why does everyone want to put those stupid flaps in front of the connectors so you can't see them?)* 60Hz refresh rate limit. Not a big deal for me, 'cuz I'm old and don't need more. (It can be bumped up to 75-85Hz or so via software, but you're not going to get 120Hz with this display.* No USB ports (not a biggie, but I've gotten used to having them)* Screen rotation (pivot) only works one direction, and even at the highest level, the corner of the screen hits the base unless you tilt it. Inconvenient if you want to frequently switch between horizontal and vertical orientations. If the stand were just half an inch higher this wouldn't be a problem.* As others have reported, there's some backlight bleed, but in my case it's not severe enough to be a major problem, and I'm not trying to use it for graphic design. It could be annoying for a professional.* Speakers are too quiet. Sound quality isn't terrible, just muffled. Probably good enough for audio conferencing, etc, but not good enough for multimedia entertainment IMO.So all-in-all, the negatives are mostly things I am not so concerned about, and the things I do care about it does well, so I'm pretty happy.",14,19,5,33,57.5757575757576,42.4242424242424

I did tons of research on monitors to come up with this one truly being the best monitor for the money without going nuts and spending double for very minimal true gains in real color accuracy and working consistency. So I get the monitor and, like all monitors, it ships in consumer settings that absolutely suck hard. I attach my X-Rite i1 Display Pro to calibrate it and find the gamut to be wider than my ViewSonic - awesome - and that it ships with an sRGB mode that is not very accurate - not so awesome. The colors are now right in order with my ViewSonic and dead on. The beauty of this monitor must be observed to truly appreciate. Once calibrated, its is honestly one of the best on the market.

This is the key thing that drove me into buying these monitors. More resolution results in more room to work, but if the resolution gets too high (4K@27"" would be too high for me) vs. the size of the monitor then things become way too hard to read (at least for me).

I especially like it for reading, writing, and browsing, since the extra pixels really make the text much crisper.I fired up Skyrim on it at full resolution (2560x1440), and it looks phenomenal.  Since the pixel density is so high, even 2x anti-aliasing is sufficient (though you should still use 8x or higher anisotropic filtering).  But if your video card cannot hack it, the monitor lets you play at lower resolutions in letterbox mode.  Diablo III furthermore looks gorgeous at 2560x1440: you can see so much of the map!The colors are bright and clear, and the wide viewing angle, crisp text, and extra screen real-estate are great for productivity applications.  Also, the monitor stand is solid and allows easy adjustment of the height and viewing angle for maximum user comfort.  This high-end monitor is well worth the extra cost above a standard 1080p screen, which I have owned for years, if you have the cash to spend.

It even comes with all the cables which surprised me because usually you have to go out and buy certain cables if you don't use them.

"448","UPDATE: After sending back the defective monitor and mulling over whether to try again or go with a different brand, I decided to test my luck and purchased this monitor again. The replacement I received is *significantly* better about color/temperature uniformity across the panel... the temperature shift I described below is still present (warm on the left, green/cool on the right), but it's much less pronounced and closer to neutral; I really have to look for it to notice it. It's good enough that I can live with it, and especially at the price, and this panel is just as good as the other one (no dead/stuck pixels, no noticeable light bleed).Despite the mixed reviews, I took a chance on this monitor, having had generally good success with many Asus products over the last decade. When I first received the monitor, I was pleased with the picture quality; backlight bleed is minimal (really almost none), no dead pixels, and colors seemed vibrant but well-defined.But, when I went to calibrate it for photo editing, I realized the panel has a *tremendous* discrepancy in temperature, from bottom-left to top-right. The left half of the panel is extremely warm, and the right half is very green. I've tried color profiles and calibration settings I've found online, but nothing accounts for such a drastic shift in temperature across the panel.This is really disappointing, since I think the main reason people get IPS-type panels is for color accuracy for photo/graphics work; I'm surprised Asus would sell this monitor without better quality control. My Dell U2715H has some heavy bleed around the edges (and later some dimming in spots, which is why I replaced it with this), but the panel temp was very consistent and very usable after calibration.

I changed the payment type and the product immediately shipped and I still received it Saturday morning!The product packaging was excellent and my unit arrived perfectly intact. I unboxed it, plugged it all in, turned it on and viola, my stunning display was up and running. Out of the box, the display settings needed a tiny bit of tweaking, but nothing I didn't expect.

Height and tilt adjustment function far better than I'd expected--easily, yet stays exactly where I put it. Picture is outstanding next to my old LG monitor; I use it for gaming, coding, and assorted hobby-level content creation (3D modeling/image editing/etc). The extra screen real estate is wonderful for multitasking, and I haven't noticed any FPS drop while gaming--just a bigger yet clearer image over my old 23"" 1920x1080. After owning this thing, I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to the cheaper monitors.",3,5,2,8,62.5,37.5
"456","I spent several weeks researching WQHD panels and eventually settled on this one. I must say I was skeptical at first due to all the reviews stating that the panel often shipped with dead/stuck pixels. After receiving mine I can confirm there are no dead/stuck pixels, just an incredibly beautiful display.I've always owned 720 and 1080p panels in the past, so of course this one will look especially amazing. So how do I tell if it's a quality panel? Well, according to all the professional reviews i've read(and from the old eye test) this monitor ships with fairly accurate colors. With a little tinkering, you can have it looking fantastic in just a few minutes. sRGB mode means professionals can tune this thing to perfection with pinpoint accuracy. While I have not done this myself (I use this monitor solely for performance gaming) it's certainly a nice feature if I ever decide to professionally calibrate this thing. Asus includes their other staple presets like Standard(my choice for gaming), Theater, User, and the previously aforementioned sRGB mode. This monitor also features a ""trace-free"" mode which helps eliminate ghosting artifacts which, in my opinion, is a welcome addition that some of my older Asus monitors did not include.Since i'm not a professional graphic designer or anything like that I can't comment on performance in those areas but one area I can comment on is gaming. In a nutshell, this monitor is stunning while playing any modern PC game. I have specifically played Battlefield 3, Skyrim, Black Ops 2, Borderlands 2 and the Witcher 2 on max settings and the detail is nothing short of amazing. The extra pixels add a dimension in gaming that I simply have not experienced before. Textures are so crisp that Anti-Aliasing is not even required. My previous monitor was 120hz 2ms response time so I was a little concerned about ghosting/lag during intense online FPS play but i'm happy to report that isn't an issue here. Was my 120hz monitor somewhat smoother? Sure, but the discernable difference in minute. Gameplay feels very natural on this monitor.The one thing you will need to run games at max settings+2560x1440 resolutions is a monster graphics card. I have a GTX 680 2gb card and I can run all games on max with the exception of Anti-Aliasing. As I stated before AA isn't needed as much with the higher resolution but that doesn't mean it's not wanted/useless. I can usually get away with 2x or 4x MSAA(plus FXAA) but any more than that and my FPS drops below 35 and thus becomes unplayable for me. 3+ GB of VRAM is needed if you truly want to max games out at 1440p. Just something to consider for people looking at this monitor for high resolution gaming.The only real knock I have against this monitor is the button layout/menu control scheme. It can be quite annoying to try and navigate/change values because the arrow buttons aren't next to each other and the functions not clearly labeled. User options can be considered minimal compared to some other models out there(such as Samsung's monitors) but that's not too big a deal because it ships looking pretty decent already. This may be an issue for some, however.Overall I would recommend this monitor to just about everyone, and especially gamers like me. The price is fantastic compared to most on the market and the build quality is certainly better than the similarly priced korean models (although some may refute this, there is always something to be said about having a real warranty). Not only is the panel fantastic, but Asus also includes connectors of every kind in the box. That was certainly an added bonus for me. Unless yours ships with dead pixels(Amazon will send you another one. it is worth the wait) you can't go wrong with this monitor.",12,28,16,40,70,30
"457","First off, it came with a dead pixel. And I also ran into a few situations where the screen teared beyond usability in some games after switch ING to 4k, even when maintaining 60 fps.

"458","This monitor is beautiful, sleek, and looks great running games like Battlefield 4.  I had heard that a lot of people end of with monitors with dead pixels or bad backlight bleeding.  I unfortunately got a screen with some intense backlight bleeding on the upper right and bottom right of the monitor.A little bit of lighter black would not be an issue, but the backlight bleeding looked like an intense yellow color seeping out that was super noticeable on a black screen, and drowned out colors on anything else.  It took up the whole upper quarter of the screen.Perhaps mine was defective, but I wouldn't take your chances with the other reviews I've read.

One would assume like new meaning barely opened or minor packaging damage, nope in my case it meant major package damage.

"462","I feel scammed. After unsuccessfully spending an stressful half hour with phone support (case number N160418601) trying to solve my issue, since I felt that this email support was going nowhere, I ended up spending even more time deep searching online about my issue, finding out to my surprise that the monitor is not truly 10-bit, even though everywhere in Asus product overviews and specifications say otherwise. My graphics card can't set the monitor to 10-bit because it isn't existent. There are not even small letters at the bottom of the page telling the truth about it. You guys are advertising something false and I bought it. On top of that, I've spent time and energy trying to set things right and you guys have played along to this unsolvable issue.You guys have an 8-bit up-scaled to ""10-bit"" display that does the trick of looking ""good"". But that's not what I bought. I bought an UHD monitor with 10-bit color because that's exactly what I needed and that's what Asus sold me. Asus has given me instead a 8-bit display, a bunch of stress and time wasted.Buying this monitor was the perfect, smart and cost-effective solution to displaying and refining the UHD visual effects work I've been working many weeks on, expecting to rely on the 10-bit display to show me gradients and bright spots more accurately at a full-scale final output of 3840x2160. Instead, I see cramped gradients and bright colors being way off. At this moment I can only use this monitor to see things at full scale, and have to ignore how the bad the rest looks.Thanks for making me buy a false product. Expect me to keep being the great customer that I've been throughout the past years.Rodrigo- ""10-bit (8-bit with FRC)"" - [...]- People not being able to set to 10-bit because it's non-existent on this monitor - [...]",12,12,0,24,50,50
"463","This monitor has several flaws that combine to make it a poor value for money. I purchased it as a third monitor so that I would have more screen real estate for software development. It compares very poorly both to my HP LP2475w and my older Dell E248WFP.First, its color accuracy is atrocious. Even after trying the color calibration found on Tom's Hardware's review of this monitor, and after trying many different combinations, I still feel that the color accuracy for red is way off. Reds display as oranges or yellows. My HP monitor, which is intended for professional color accuracy, displays an excellent true red, but even the less saturated red that my nothing-special-Dell monitor produces with default settings is superior to anything achievable on this ASUS. Also, each display preset gives the overall screen either a very yellowish hue or a blue overcast, with nothing in-between; none of the presets render a satisfactory ""white.""The other major problem is sharpness, which may be related to the screen size (28"" widescreen) simply being too small for a 4k monitor. (My fault for buying it.) The monitor is torn between two unacceptable conditions: the sharpness setting turned down, which results in fuzzy, unreadable text, or the sharpness setting turned up to about 60, which makes text readable, but destroys video game graphics and photos.Each of the display presets has a tradeoff, whether it introduces aliasing to graphics (due to the sharpness setting), insults colors, blurs text as though you are underwater, or is simply far too dim. This might be less frustrating if each preset allowed all of its settings to be changed, but certain settings are disabled with certain presets. The placement of the buttons on the back of the monitor is also very unfortunate - it makes the buttons hard to line up with the on-screen icons, and it hurt my hand after a while trying to change the settings.I am probably going to send this unit back and do more research (not just reading customer reviews) before attempting another purchase.",17,5,-12,22,22.7272727272727,77.2727272727273

"465","Hello everyone,I'm writing my review after having the product and using it intensively for about a month.from the first day it has been working as expected, no dead pixel, very nice resolution.It's worth to mention that this product is pro, i.e. is made for designers, web designers, 3D model/object designers, (and many other...) who pay attention to every pixel on the screen. If you want to have a everyday monitor just for playing games or watching movie I think 1080 is quite sufficient with at least $200 savings. (But again this is my personal opinion)speakers are fine, don't expect too much.

"467","I've used this monitor for about a week now, and I'm heavily impressed with the quality. There are no dead pixels, the viewing angle is wider than I've experienced so far, and the colors are much more vibrant than my first monitor that I still use as a secondary display, the Samsung SMS23A55H. The finishing on the screen, especially, is stellar, as it doesn't seem to be matte exactly, but looks glossy while being fairly anti-glare and anti-reflective. Overall, I am highly impressed.There are a few flaws, however, though I think most will find these minor (or at least expected). The controls for the monitor are some of the worst I've seen. The buttons are not intuitive at all, though I expect most will get used to them after a few days of fiddling, and the speakers are terrible. If you buy basically a 700 dollar monitor, do yourself a favor and get a dedicated sound system with at least a sub-woofer. Lack of any USB ports is a minus, though I was pleasantly surprised by the included cables. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.",6,9,3,15,60,40

"469","--The product:Amazing picture, great build quality, great I/O, amazing product for the money. I really want another one or two for my multipurpose setup, it's a matter of time. The only recommendation to Asus is that these ship in DisplayPort 1.2 mode instead of 1.1. I am currently on my second week of my replacement monitor with no issues. The first product shipped to me with a cluster of bad pixels that I discovered on day one, no big deal, no sweat, it happens. Amazon is the way to go because I received my replacement before I got a chance to ship back the first one. The build quality of this guy makes me feel like it will last a decade, which is what I value most in a display. Function over form is the idea behind this monitor's stand and bezel.The hue/tone of this display is warming and a bit more yellow than your average display but I personally prefer it over an LED blue tinted white. It can be adjusted and compensated for anyway. The viewing angles are definitely not the best but have not bugged me either. If you plan on using this off to the side frequently, then you may wish for a different panel. For me, since the stand is super, freaking adjustable I never have to worry about viewing angles.--The concept and technology:4K is still sort of an experimental, grease-monkey technology in the PC world. You'll need to do some research before you jump in, or you could find yourself puzzled by terrible performance. You will need to run display port to use full 4K, otherwise you're stuck in 30fps refresh rate which is a world of hurt, don't do it. For gaming at full 4K you will need to fork out a little bit for a decent GPU. While a GTX 760 was amazing for 1080p it does not stand a chance in 4K, and 4Gig VRAM is minimum.This monitor actually pushed me into using my free Windows 8 upgrade because Windows 7 just doesn't scale as well as I'd hope to this pixel density. Certain text just wouldn't scale right and be as readable in 4K 28inch. Windows 8 handles it so much better when you bump some of the scaling and text sizes. I also understand that Windows 10 is supposed to make it even smoother a transition.This is the size you want for media, pictures, and gaming... I will never want to go back to 1080p resolution. This size and resolution is the sweet spot, especially for gaming. You won't find much video or any movies out there in 4K yet but that's a whole different story.If you want normal, readable text but don't want to scale everything up, you'll want a screen bigger than this. Of course if you just more screen real estate you might as well just get a bunch of normal resolution monitors, and you can buy three of these for the price of one 32inch version. Never the less, the real estate is still a massive boost as it is for every type of use. And if you upgrade to a bigger size of 4K monitor, you won't have the sharpness you get with this pixel density. This is the sweet spot, it's like looking through a window instead of VHS recording.I will update this review if anything changes,",9,25,16,34,73.5294117647059,26.4705882352941
"470","[edit ***]The monitor was still under warranty, so was able to send it for repair. I think I got a different physical unit [a couple extra dead pixels]. This mostly worked out well, except I had to ship the thing across the country at my own expense. Shipping + packing cost me over $100. So the warranty worked, ASUS fixed the problem, I still like the device.[original review **]Bought this monitor in July of 2013 for over $550, which was a good price at the time. The monitor had a dead pixel or two on arrival but that doesn't bother me. It was otherwise well constructed and did the job. Since the beginning of 2015 I noticed that one of the physical buttons went dead. It was annoying because I couldn't navigate the menu, but wasn't a huge deal becuase my settings were ok. Since the beginning of 2016 seems like that button is sending a random signal. The monitor now cycles through its modes [standard/scenery/theater] randomly, sometimes in rapid succession. Means the monitor is basically unusable. A $550 monitor that worked properly for less than two years and is dead weight after two and a half.",9,10,1,19,52.6315789473684,47.3684210526316

Go with an el-cheapo one, doesn't make any difference).Build quality is excellent, plastics are very nice and the mount is really top notch: every movement (tilt, rotate and height adjustment) is extremely smooth and allow a quick and accurate orientation. If you have a narrow desk take a couple of extra measurements because the stand is significantly deeper than your usual consumer grade monitor.Image is really good, no banding at all (I've tried to do some color gradients in Photoshop and they came out very smooth, without artifacts or posterization), some light leak from the lower part of the bezel, but nothing too obnoxious.Speakers are fine: i like the fact that, being placed somewhere behind the panel, they give the illusion that the sound is coming from the screen itself (that makes videoconferencing extremely pleasant). One single negative point, adjusting the volume is not so quick, you need to push a couple of buttons and there is no mute option... better to leave it on a value and use windows controls for thatIn very few words: strongly recommended, very nice product",3,17,14,20,85,15

I was missing out on 1440p and amazing detail for so long, especially since I invested in my gaming rig to be able to perform at this level.  I played Battlefield 4, Arma 3, DayZ, and Guild Wars 2 so far.  1440p makes a huge difference in clarity and experience.  The 27"" size is great too, I was upgrading from a 22"" 1080p monitor.  Couldn't recommend this more!",0,5,5,5,100,0

"488","Best monitor I have ever used... The 60 Hz 4K refresh rate is so important for me.  It creates a crystal clear image with no mouse trail ghosting.  I use it at 1440p @ 60 Hz for gaming, since my computer doesn't quite have the power for full 4k gaming.  I find the experience pleasant.  Then, during the day, I use 4K to hook it up to my work laptop for maximum office-environment productivity.--------------Update 9/24/2015- I RMAed the monitor because I thought it was broken only to find out **it was the Displayport cable** that was the issue!!  (Long story, but on one computer the inputs would cycle, it would display the desktop for a second and then the backlight would turn off, and on another computer would otherwise work fine but would disconnect for 1 second every 30-60 seconds.However, ASUS Warranty and Tech Support were amazingly easy to deal with!  They shipped out a new monitor and provided shipping labels for me, so I shipped back my old monitor in the new box.  Sorry for the trouble, but thank you for the great support and wonderful, reassuring  3-year warrantyPrior to this monitor I had a 1440p Korean monitor, but had warranty issues and there is no way to make the money back on that RMA...

"489","I am very impressed with this ASUS monitor not only because of it's beautiful display but also the mechanical and electronic adjustments just feel right, like a well designed monitor.  The display controls are easy to use and very intuitive.  Tilt, swivel and height are smooth and easy to accomplish without struggling. In the 2560x1440 resolution mode 4K program material and even 1080p look amazing on a 27"" screen.  The built-in speakers sound considerably better than the very inexpensive USB pair I had been using, but of course they cannot be expected to compete with high priced sound systems.  DisplayPort cable was a little difficult to insert because of its location.  Monitor powered up right away in native resolution, and the only adjustment I made was to reduce the brightness a little.I remember paying $1000 for a 21"" CRT boat anchor monitor years ago.  At ~$400, this ASUS is infinitely better and an amazing piece of technology.",2,16,14,18,88.8888888888889,11.1111111111111
"490","Fantastic picture, miserable sound.  How much more would it cost manufacturer to increase speaker wattage by 2 lousy watts?  Typical and ridiculously low standard in monitor speakers by ALL manufacturers, not just Asus.  The base is quite heavy (solid metal, it seems) which is a safety feature against accidental tipover, I guess.  Easy to set up and start, but hidden buttons on the back are really stupid and take some getting used to.I got a 4k for gaming, but if you get this to do that be reminded that you need a big graphics card and possibly other support to make it work, although the picture does improve noticeably even without it (depending on what you have now).  I was using a 1080p TV (6 ms response time) as a monitor with a gtx 770 card in my computer and the picture and action was pretty good in Fallout 3.  Soon after buying this Asus monitor I swapped that card for a gtx 970 and the gaming went from pretty good to utterly incredible.  Neither monitor nor card are cheap, but it's a big step up in imaging and response time.  You can see the pores in people's skin, and from 20' away you can see that Bottflies have green blood.Those 2 upgrades put you in the big league.  Just wish the speakers were better.",8,12,4,20,60,40

Screen is perfect, colors are perfect, no audio issues, amazing wide-angle viewing, etc.Starting in February, my monitor started having DisplayPort issues. I would turn on my computer, but the monitor wouldn't detect anything. Or it would happen if I leave the computer on for a while unattended and it goes to sleep mode. Then the monitor would no longer detect anything. I thought it was my computer or cable that caused this problem, but after reading online, I realized it was the monitor itself. The only solution I found was to unplug the power cord from the monitor, wait a minute, then plug it back in. Then it all works again. As of now I won't return it just yet, but I'll be more concerned if this starts happening more often or if the unplugging method stops working.",4,6,2,10,60,40

"498","Just received this monitor today.  Previously had a nice Dell 27-inch 1080P monitor, but found at that size with that resolution, the pixels were too large (the pixel density was too low for me).  Also it was a glossy screen and bezel, which I found very frustrating due to constant glare.  This ASUS monitor offers higher resolution at the same size, and thus greater pixel density.  The difference is clear as day.  It's gentler on my eyes due to this, and the colors are true and crisp.  There are no dead pixels.  It came with one of every cable it supports!  (One HDMI, one DisplayPort, one DVI-D, one VGA, one power cable, and one 1/8"" audio cable.)  The included monitor stand is quite nice: It supports rotating the monitor 90 degrees, tilt, and several inches of height adjustment (on my previous Dell monitor I'd had to have it on a separate stand in order to have it tall enough; not necessary with the ASUS!).The only ""negatives"" I can say at this point are nits.  The included power cable is pretty short.  It will be fine for most people but if you want to hide the cables, you might need a longer one to allow you to run it where you want.  The other concern is that the location on the monitor where the cables are connected is very close to the bezel.  The connector on my DVI cable was very nearly too thick to be attached to the monitor.  There simply isn't much room between the connector and the bezel.  I did manage to get it connected, but there's no reason this should even be an issue.  ASUS should move the connectors away from the bezel by a few millimeters and it would not be a problem.",7,9,2,16,56.25,43.75
"499","Before buying this monitor, I read all the reviews, both here and at other vendors.  I find that buyer's reviews are the best, because they don't accept advertising, and they are not compensated (however, since this is a favorable review, I could with good conscience  accept a bribe...lol!).  The monitor arrived today and replaces a 22"" TFT monitor.  I bought it primarily for the rave reviews of its color rendition.  Assembly and setup was simple.  Out of the box, the display is spectacular, as attested by many previous reviewers.  When I started Lightroom and Photoshop, I was amazed at the detail in my pictures that I had been missing.  This is pretty much a repeat of most of the previous reviews, except for one thing.  I have been using an AMD 6800 series video card in my pc, and ordered a new GTX 660 because I was assured by the reviewers that I would need at least a 7000 series or 600 and above series video card to display the 2560x1440 resolution.  My new card hasn't arrived, and when I booted up with my old card, it automatically set the highest resolution using the dvi port.  If things stay good, I'll ship the new card back, when it arrives.This is a very good monitor.  I'm quickly adjusting to the increased real estate that the 27"" gives.

"508","This is a very high quality monitor with a beautiful display.  Recently I ungraded to a HP H9-1170 computer with a 2560x1440 hd graphic card.  So I purchased this monitor and also the Nixeus 2560X1440 monitor to match my new computer.  This ASUS monitor arrived today.  It was easy to set up and the color looks good out of box.I am a glamour photographer and collects photos of beautiful models.  This monitor makes the models glow and look great.  The models look sharp crisp and pops out.  I noticed details I donot see with my previous 1920x1080 monitors. The OSD is easy to use to change settings.  For best photos I suggest one set sharpness, brightness and contrast to 100%.  Saturation and hue to 50%.  The next trick is to set temperature to cool otherwise the models skin tone will look too red.  I made all these settings while watching my favorite slide show, that way I know exactly the results will be to my liking.  Remember you must choose user mode in order to be out of the standard modes and make you own choices for settings.  By the way the screen is perfect and black is real black, white real white.This monitor has a semi gloss screen.  It is not thick as to affect sharpness and does not create a fog over black  as some heavily coated matte screen.  I am holding my final judgement on the coating.  All things equal I prefer glossy screens.  Pictures always look sharper in a glossy screen. Waiting for the arrival of the Nixeus monitor which has a glossy screen.  I will put both monitors side by side to make an AB comparison. Will update my evaluation at that time.11/29/2012My Nixeus hd 2560 monitor shipping was delayed to Dec 12 so I can not able to do my semi glossy and glossy screen test.

The slightest shaking or moving of the monitor and the video image is lost. I have to jiggle the cable, no matter what kind of cable I use, close my eyes and pray and most of the time I can get the connection reestablished. The second problem seems to be a firmware problem with this monitor. Whenever the monitor hibernates when you first get it the display port connection is lost again! You have to go into the UEFI settings on your motherboard and make some adjustments to the low power settings to fix this. Fixing that was quick and fairly easy but it's still obnoxious that you have to do this kind of fiddling with this monitor just to make the display port image work properly. Everything else is awesome including: the zero backlight bleed (something that I've never seen with an IPS panel before), no glossy bezels and screen so no heavy reflection from other lights on your screen, the image itself and color representation, the stable and ergonomic stand, and the adjustable screen angles.

However, shortly after purchasing the monitor, the monitor would not wake up if it was put to sleep for an extended period of time. This was happening on and off for about a month and a half. I ignored the problem as it was only happening with the Display Port. At first I thought it was my Custom PC. I thought perhaps the graphics card was acting out and I changed a bunch of settings in my BIOS. Nothing helped. I was getting SOOOOO frustrated because it would only turn back on whenever it felt like it. Today, I figured out that it was the actual monitor after attempting to connect my Macbook using a Mini Displayport -> Displayport cable. The Macbook wasn't being recognized either, so I knew it wasn't a computer related or GPU issue. After resetting the monitor, by unplugging it, the display port signal was recognized again. Is this a serious problem? YES.....Is it an annoying one that lowers the quality of the monitor for me significantly, YES.

"524","Received this monitor early Wednesday. I spent all day trying to get it to work properly.First, it took over two hours for my PC to even recognize that the PB287 as a device was connected to it via the Displayport cable included in the box. I checked and rechecked the DP connection to my monitor and to my GPUS. I tediously switched which GPU I plugged the DP into a few times (turning everything off each time) each time not succeeding.I tried many times to switch to the display through Nvidia Control panel and Windows itself before it finally recognized it AND switched over on its own.I know it might sound like I have no idea what I am talking about, but I also have a 120hz and a 1440p IPS monitors, and am quite familiar with this simple and basic procedure. There is something wrong here.When I finally got the monitor to display an image, I went into the cumbersome menu and activated DP 1.2 for 60hz 4K. I tried out a few games for about 30 minutes. Here are the positives I can say in this brief time on my SLi 780Ti PC:The image quality is astounding, and this is coming from someone who already had a 1440p IPS. I was still floored all the same. Even better, there is virtually no ghosting in fast-moving images or first person perspectives thanks to it being a TN panel instead of IPS. Motion is FAR smoother with the PB287 in comparison. Every game I tested with zero AA of any kind had smoother edges  than 1440p with 4XMSAA. Maybe even 8xMSAA. The pixel density is a beauty to behold.Also, and I have no idea why, Watch Dogs plays more smoothly at 4K than it did in 1440p. I used the same exact settings with each monitor (other than turning the Temporal SMAA off in 4k, which is very low AA setting anyways) with High Textures/LOD, Ultra Water, etc. and not only it looks far sharper, there is FAR less stutter. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of fps drops, sometimes in the high 30s, but mostly 45-60 even in dense areas with much havok going on.Shortly after testing Watch Dogs and a few other games, the left half of my screen flickered white very fast before resuming that half of the image that was on the screen prior. From then on, in every game I tested (both using Vsync on and off in each title) I had a horizontal ""line"" going down the middle of the screen. Moving the camera around, the image would tear along this invisible line, like the left half of the monitor was out of synch with the right half by a fraction of a second.This screen-tearing is very similar to playing without Vsync, except it is horizontal instead of vertical, and it is persistent. Not a moment goes by without the tearing occurring. This is how every other moment I had playing today went for hours straight, and it isn't only during games. Closing a fullscreen tab in my browser results in the same thing: The left half is a half second delayed in revealing what is underneath it compared to the right side. The ""crease"" is exactly where the screen-tearing occurs during gaming.Resetting my PC cleared the issue for 5-10 minutes each try, but the white flicker followed by horizontal tearing comes back each time. Then my PC stopped recognizing the monitor. I rolled back from the latest Nvidia Driver to the second newest. More hours of testing without getting it to be recognized. This lasted for most of the rest of the day, me trying in vain to get it back. Finally, got it working for an hour (while tolerating the tearing) it lost connection AGAIN.Some thoughts:This is not 1ms response time. It is way better than a 1440p IPS in regards to input lag, but still no where near 1ms. I feel this being marketed in such a way is quite simply a lie.The ""line"" going right down the middle and the left side being slightly out of sync with the right side seems like something that could happen with slightly older 4K monitors that were two 30hz panels each requiring a separate HDMI cable being ""stitched together"" to comprise the monitor. But the PB287 is described in many reviews as one of the first 4k monitors with a unified panel. Surely ASUS isn't lying, but this is still weird.Major issues getting the monitor to communicate with my PC. Strange severe image issues. Probably just a bad DP cable, right? I only have the one that came in the box. I start thinking I would actually pay money to buy another one just to be done with this whole ordeal....but then I see 35 PB287 reviewers on another retailer's site where the vast majority are having connection issues and horizontal tearing just like me. Many claim to hear a loud popping sound coming from their units as well. I play with headphones on, so it is possible and maybe that happened to mine? Anyways, one of the reviewers claimed to have tried four different DP cables and none of them fixed his issues that are identical to mine. So I will not throw money at the wind trying to replace the DP cable the monitor came with.I will be contacting Amazon Customer Support after I wake up later on. I am far too tired of messing with this all day to wait in queue right now. I will be seeking a refund and not a replacement due to the number of early reports make me think it is a widespread issue at the core of the product.I will update the review and score after this gets resolved, but I cannot recommend this monitor under any condition right now.",27,27,0,54,50,50

The picture is sharp, and this screen's refresh rate has no problems playing high speed FPS games.Cons:I have a single dead pixel near the center of the screen. It is an dark dead pixel eye sore that has constantly drawn my attention on white backgrounds. I would have been fine with a dead pixel if it had been on one of the edges, but having it so close to the middle of the screen is very annoying.Final thoughts:First dead pixel I've had the misfortune of finding on a screen i have purchased, and this one was by far the most expensive screen i have owned.The pixel is so annoying that I checked to see if i could return this screen and found this on their support page:----Since LCD panel is made up of millions of micro electronic pixels, if one pixel no longer functions normally, it will become a bright or dark dot.

"529","Before I order this 4k monitor, I ordered a Monoprice 30"" LED - after using this monitor for a while, I'm so glad that I made the right decision to return the Monoprice and get this instead.First of all, 4k monitor is so clear! I use this along side with my 2014 15"" mbp with Retina display. The monitor is connected to MBP using a MiniDisplayport-to-Displayport cable. This cable supports DisplayPort 1.2 so I can use the 4k monitor at full resolution (3840x2160)@60Hz. In my opinion, the monitor delivers similar quality compare to the Retina. Regarding the color, since I'm a software developer not a graphics designer, I'm fairly happy with the color and brightness.Outside of work, I also use this monitor to play games. The response rate (1ms according to advertisement) is pretty good and I do not notice any lag.However, there are two things I think the monitor can be improved:1. Factory setting by default uses display port 1.1 which support UHD 4k @ 30hz only. I had to go into the monitor OSD to manually change it to 1.2. It's disappointing that the monitor couldn't auto detect it.2. I set the monitor resolution to 1920x1080 for my desktop (Raedon 290x) when I'm playing games. At 60hz the display content didn't zoom to full screen. I had to modify my display driver settings to set the refresh rate to 50hz for it to show full screen. Personally I'm fine with 50hz since I use my desktop to play games only.After all, I would definitely recommend this 4k monitor.",1,15,14,16,93.75,6.25

While it's small in comparison to the big screen TVs out there, the quality more than makes up for it and since I'm not willing (able) to pay for thousands of dollars more for a comparable quality big screen, I'd rather take the hit on size than quality.

"540","This was a great purchase.  I use this for promo display at various trade shows; it's been either shipped or checked baggage nearly every week so far this year (as of mid-Mar, 2015), and even the packaging has held up fairly well - the box even has a handle so I can attach it to my suitcase strip and keep my extra hand free if needed.  Granted, the box is nearing the end of it's life span without a LOT more strapping tape!  But, this review is about the product, not the packaging.If I remember correctly, I did have to order the HDMI cable to connect from the computer, but I think there are some others cables that come with it; there's one for sound, I'm pretty sure (just haven't used it) and there's a velcro strap included to keep cords tidy as well. In any case, it was simple to connect and set up.I always use it in vertical mode for my display (which is specifically why I purchased this particular model), and it easily reads the desired setting from my computer.

"544","Probably the most affordable, and well featured 4K out there right now. Totally solid. Some of the other 4Ks I looked at didn't support 60Hz at the full resolution, which is just ridiculous, but it can be hard to tell without really digging in sometimes, because they'll still list that it's ""60Hz capable"", which is ridiculous. I bought this for a coworker, and he's loved it, though I don't personally have one of my own yet.I'll mention that my light Carbon X1 Lenovo running a recent Ubuntu plugged in and utilized the 4K without any issues. Apparently some driver changes in recent OSXs means that most MBPs will not be able to handle 4K. There was _one_ short range of the Retina machines (perhaps late 2013?) that do not have this problem. My friend just happened to have one, and this monitor monitor worked fine for him, though he might have had to go tweak some settings to get it to work at the correct resolution or refresh rate; don;'t remember exactly. So, long story short, do your homework. OSX may have already gotten better about supporting 4K, but you should make sure before purchasing. If you're running Ubuntu, don't worry, you're fine.

At the most inopportune times, a sound will emanate from the monitor (like a static scratch) and I'll lose video on the monitor and soon get a ""no signal"" or some such error.  I have to unplug the cable from my laptop and plug it back in and all's well.  It usually only happens once, sometimes twice a day with no known ""trigger"" that I can identify.  It does it when I'm browsing the web, when I'm gaming, it doesn't matter.  Since it only occurs rarely, it's not too big of an issue:  just unplug cable, plug it back in, then move my windows back to the screen and all's well (at least it doesn't take down my whole system).

I will note that you need to use the Display Port in order to get the WQHD, which i was not initially aware of, but it comes with the cable so as long as you have a video card with that port you should be good to go as long as you have a Display Port on your graphics card.But that one piece out of the way, this monitor is AMAZING!  The WQHD resolution is the best!! Multiple browser windows, multiple documents, having documents and browsers up fully visable at the same time, doing graphics or web editing...

The colors are vibrant and it looks simple. It has VESA-compatible mounting options and the stand it comes with is fully adjustable. Because it is an IPS monitor, the viewing angles are very good. If someone is looking for an everyday workhorse, I would highly recommend this monitor. Because it has a claimed 100% sRGB color range, it's good for photo and video work. It's decent for games, but if you're looking for something with minimal lag and response times, then this probably isn't the best choice. At 60Hz, it also doesn't have the best refresh rate.

"559","I've had this monitor since July 10, and I absolutely love it. I first wanted the PG278Q 1440P monitor that has GSYNC along with 144hz, but ASUS kept on pushing the release date back. I got a very good deal on this one, so I had to jump on it. The monitor had no problems with dead pixels. I prefer to use the scenery mode when gaming. I have 2 EVGA GTX 780 6GB in SLI, and they run perfectly at 1440p, with most games hitting above 60FPS. Because of this, I tried overclocking the monitor to 80hz. So far it was stable, but it became a little glitchy in games. However, I'm becoming worried it will ruin my monitor, so I backed it down to 60hz. Now, for the speakers. I personally believe they are 100% fantastic. Everything sounds so crisp to me, and they are very loud at max volume. From other reviews, I see people with the average ""they are monitor speakers... what else did you expect"" type of review. Of course they aren't $300 external speakers, but they are dang close to it. I have no complaint about the speakers.I have 2 cons (maybe 3)- when I first received the monitor, it kept telling me that the display port was getting no signal. This would happen about 3 times a day. I contacted support, and they kept trying to help me, but failed. Repeatedly told me it's a hardware issue and that I need to RMA it. Then about 3 weeks ago, I figured out the problem. For some reason, you need to turn the monitor on first, before the computer. If the computer is on first, it will get ""NO SIGNAL, and immediately go into standby mode. I'm very unhappy about this. This shouldn't happen on a $500 purchase.The second con is the backlight bleed. The top corners are decent, but the bottom 2 corners are absolutely terrible. I didn't want to do a return, so I just kept it. For spending close to $500 (after the price drops, I believe it was around $700 when I was first released), I wasn't satisfied with the ASUS quality control.One very little con is the size of the bezel. If I don't decide on getting the ROG Swift, I would like to add 2 more PB278Q's for NVIDIA SURROUND. The bezel is pretty thick, so it's going to be tough to look at 2 huge lines in the middle. But this is a possibility... Not sure if I will get 2 more.Overall I'm very satisfied with the monitor, let alone 1440p. I'm coming from a 19"" Visio TV (1080p), and the upgrade is great. But I'll be honest... It's very hard to tell the difference between 1080p and 1440p when gaming. ASUS Quality Control on this monitor isn't the best. I'm still very unsatisfied with the black light bleed and the ""NO SIGNAL""",15,19,4,34,55.8823529411765,44.1176470588235
"560","Pros: Great monitor, it has good color reproduction, high resolution, every type of port needed to achieve the high resolution it provides.

The slight back-light bleed on my unit is located on the top left and bottom right of the screen, other than that it is working perfectly. Since the back-light bleed is a known issue and also not that noticeable, I didn't decide on doing an RMA since, I might get a replacement which is worse than the new one I have bought.

After returning two late 2012 iMacs with display issues to Apple then buying a Mac Mini from Apple, I got an NEC EA232WMI from B&H in NYC that buzzed like an old CRT and had to pay almost $50 to ship it back to them.",5,4,-1,9,44.4444444444444,55.5555555555556

I purchased the Used-Like New unit and it is like new.( At the time I also saved $40 over new but the price has gone up recently). Many of the features are the same or similar. I like the vertical adjustment of this model and the stability of the stand. I don't find the ""utilitarian appearance"" bothersome. In fact, I like the clean simple lines. I also prefer the pushbuttons rather than the touch buttons as they were easy to activate by accident, since you didn't actually have to touch them. The mfg. choice of which buttons to use may have to do with the stability of the stand. I am not a tech savvy person but to my eye this monitor is significantly better. It is sharper, cleaner and the colors really pop. I went to the Microsoft wallpaper web site and installed Splattered Paint Pots found under Arts(photographic). The colors are amazing! I didn't have to make any adjustments out of the box to suit my taste, which was nice. This model also has a more HD image, which I like. I don't notice any light bleeding or similar issues.

Monitor 'power save' mode is not enough.

I do foresee a major graphics card update in my future.Pros- Full 4K over DP- Much better colors when compared to other TN panels. Definitely not an IPS though.- Amazing response time for gaming (1ms).- Cool running temp because of the LED Backlighting.- I can't comment on the stand too much as I'm using my own VESA mount. But from the videos and my brief look at it, it is definitely an upgrade from Samsungs equivalent. Not to mention when compared to other standard computer screen mounts.Major Cons- The light-bleed on the edges of the screen is a unacceptable for the price range this monitor is in. My 3+ year old >$200 LED and lamp back-lit monitors don't have close to any bleeding. It's not noticeable in typical gameplay, but if you plan to watch any fullscreen movie or YouTube video, it's definitely disappointing to see. You even get some dark shadows on the edges on a full white screen.- The buttons - the button placement is horrid when going through the UI. I dread ever having to use the menu. If you're using it for 4K, you almost have to because for some reason ASUS chooses the lesser 30hz over 4k setting when using it through DP.- Default settings - Make the 4K setting at 60hz by default.

It's the perfect balance between matte and glossy.-Cheaper than the Ultrasharp 2713HM-3rd panel seems perfect on first inspectionCons:-Stand is terrible.  It has adjustments, but they are all awkward.  It slides all over the desk.-No ""real"" cable management.  The thing on the back tries to compensate, but it is not as well done as the Ultrasharp series.-No USB hub.-OSD is not as good as the UltrasharpFinal thoughts: I take back the negative things I have to say about quality control for this specific monitor, because it seems they all have lemons, and I was just unlucky several times in a row.  I stand behind the new cons though.I give the panel 4/5 stars because it took 3 tries to get a perfect one.

"597","After unboxing the PB238Q I used it as a second monitor on my MacBook Retina which is the hardest competitor you could imagine. But I am think I searched long enough and found what I was searching for. I wanted to have a IPS panel with the latest plugs (HDMI, DVI, maybe USB…) This device came with all that and had as well speakers included. So lets go with it. The unboxing wasn't a big deal and I was surprised about the very stable foot. It came packed in the vertical way and I just had to rotate the monitor 90 deg. Then I realized that if you rotate it it is very useful to plug in all the cables. I have been to a store around here to by a HDMI cable. I need the regular plug for the MacBook but I would not need it for the PC which came a day later. What I mean is, there is a HDMI cable included but it is not the hexagon (standard) version it has only five corners!) Then the first star up – it took me a decade to find out how I can activate it unter my OS. And usually I am skilled with things like that. The problem was just, that I had do unplug it one more time and then plug it again. I don't know why he did not recognize it. The setup (same ICC profile) and adjustment to the monitor settings went very well and quick. Now they both look very similar. To be hones the PB238Q has no chance against a retina display the picture looks unsharp the color a little bit to saturated and the brightness of the retina is not reachable with the PB238Q. But lets be honest the PB238Q is a 200 $ device compared to a 1300 $ device it can never beat the Retina. (I just compared the price difference between the regular MacBook vs. the Retina and took the difference as a price for just the Retina display). This is just a suggestion not reality. So my opinion is that I got what I asked for. A cheap display with IPS technique, a quick response (gray to gray), 23 "" and pretty good reviews from other customers. I have got speakers, it has got USB ports on the left side, TCO5.2 and you can really deactivate it (that is important for me).

"602","Have been debating on upgrading my monitor setup for the past couple of months and finally settle with this. I originally had 2 AOC I2757 27"" 1080p monitors and they worked but lacked in many areas, after one started having screen tearing issues I decided it was time to try something different. I originally toyed with a 4k system but either due to most having only a 30hz refresh rate or being extremely expensive if they do have a 60hz rate, I shied away from those option. I also looked into 144hz monitors because I like to game every so often, I turned those down due to all are tn based panels and eventually wanting a dual monitor setup again I turned them down also. That leads only two option I could go with ultra thin bezel 1080p setup or 1440, guess what won. I probably looked through 10 youtube reviews before I decided on this particular model, mainly due to all the right options: matte screen, matte bezel, vesa mount(this sealed the deal), thin bezel, fully adjustable stand, great build quality. It's crazy that this monitor is almost a year old and still one of the best 1440 monitors. As far as hardware goes it does tax your video card quite a bit more. Gaming wise I would say you would need at least a 700 series card or 600 sli'd (no ideo on amd's sorry) to run this at medium + quality. I have a 690 and it handles everything on high pretty well, I tried titanfall on ultra and it started to get a little hairy and unplayable( I don't know if it was a driver issue or what). Overall great buy and will be buying another one in the future after I upgrade my video card.",8,13,5,21,61.9047619047619,38.0952380952381

One condition there - when I need to switch input from iMac to another computer I have to go through a set of menus which is a pain. Thankfully I only have to do it once in a while so it's not too bad, but if I had to do it say once an hour - it would be a major annoyance.",6,4,-2,10,40,60

You have to go through so many menus to get it to work, or switch it around... I just went out and bought a switch box so I could hook 2 video sources into it.  Really poor execution of a key feature I used to choose the ASUS over the Samsung.  But in the end I paid a couple of dollars less, and got a a great monitor.And as a side note...

I did have some issues with driver conflicts due to my on-board audio conflicting with the audio over display functionality of the video card that I have (Asus Strix GTX 970). The graphics are really clear and sharp. Color definition appears to be deep and my blacks are dark. It is hard to believe the image quality of this display as it is my first 4K unit. Be sure to use the display port on your video card as HDMI will not handle the resolutions needed for 4K. The monitor does come with cables, so that was an extra bonus. I would recommend this monitor to anyone wanting to step up into 4K.",5,5,0,10,50,50
"607","l have had this monitor for over a year now, and I've never had anything I wanted it to do that it couldn't. It delivers beautiful clarity, the saturation can go so over the top that you'll never want to put it above 85, and the finish on the screen never shows any reflections of the sunlight behind me, allowing it to have slightly lower brightness without it being dim. It is also very forgiving about smudges and fingerprints because of the finish. I have never cleaned it off and I noticed recently that it has many smudges on it that disappear once it's turned on. It's great for gaming... turning around and looking every which way constantly checking behind corners and behind you it doesn't skip, tear, or fail. It's great for movie/TV viewing. It's also great at displaying crisp menus and UI in Photoshop, iTunes, Premiere, Final Cut Pro, etc. The only limitation of the quality you will see is the quality of the image being sent to it by the program.",5,7,2,12,58.3333333333333,41.6666666666667

I also think that this is the perfect resolution for this size right now.

"610","I have had this monitor for over a month now. My older 24"" monitor was demoted to wife duty (She uses her computer less than I. Obviously I asked her if she wanted a new monitor before I bought my new one.  :lol: ) After 2 days of use with my new monitor I installed my old monitor on my wife's computer. When she turned it on and booted Windows, I realized just how bad my old TN panel with .27mm pixel pitch was.The Asus PB278Q has a great viewing angle just like IPS panels. The PLS panel is identical in this regard.The higher resolution, which is 4 times that of standard high definition standards, is very clean. Gaming is very nice with clean edges and textures. The response time is good but the monitor is natively 60Hz. There are tools which allow this monitor to run at 85Hz but most users report jittery image. Running it at 75Hz works without issue.Back light bleed is decent but not perfect. When the monitor's brightness is set higher there is some bleed in the lower left corner. Luckily higher brightness levels are undesirable to me. At what I find to be a normal brightness level the back light bleed is indiscernible.The anti glare is called a semi gloss. I hate any form of anti glare. Anti glare diffuses the light coming through the pixels. This monitor isn't as bad as some of the Dell monitors. Removing the coating may be something in my future. I enjoy glossy monitors however I always put lighting behind the monitor and not in front of it. Primary use will be in a room with only the light behind the monitor.The stand is nice. The swivel base is a bit gimmicky. Basically it's just a wheel they added on after the fact so they can say it swivels. It doesn't seem to cause issues but I feel like it doesn't aide the swivel action what so ever.The OSD menu is standard in its use and layout. The options are nice enough. I will be able to calibrate it and make any adjustments needed in the OSD menu. There are no phase controls but I haven't seen too many issues with phase. No geometry controls either however most modern LCDs to not need adjustments in this department.I haven't checked the color yet. I will be calibrating it and checking the color soon. I will report back with my findings and results. 100% of sRGB color space isn't anything special but with some adjustments this monitor should be decent. If you need to color match for commercial work this monitor might not be for you. For movies, gaming and some light graphical work the color has plenty of punch.[EDIT]Color Calibration[/EDIT]I just ran Pantone's Huey S5 Pro calibrator on the ""User"" profile I had setup and the ""sRGB"" profile. Ticking the before and after/preview button revealed a slight difference on both profiles. I think the biggest difference is in the brightness levels.

"613","At first glance this monitor does not catch your eye, but oh does it deliver with quality and functionality. And people who say the buttons on the back are horrible, there are markers for the buttons themselves so your not blindly looking for hours on end. But for me the 4k is why I purchased a 600 dollar monitor. Let me say that I have never owned a 4k monitor but am glad I made the jump to do so. When I first played dota, csgo, a.c black flag, watch dogs, my jaw dropped at how stunning the game looked. Could I go back to 1080p.. NO WAY! Once you see what you've been missing (gaming wise) you can never go back. I did purchase a gtx 970 because I thought my gtx 760 couldn't run 4k effectively, but both cards did well, but I'm glad I upgraded. The 970 on almost max settings in assassins creed held at about 45-50 fps. That's not even in SLI! If your are on the fence about getting this monitor I would say go for it, you can't get a better brand or sexier picture.

"614","I have to edit my review given the updated circumstances. Just over a month after I purchased the screen (just out of RMA range) an entire line of pixels died on the screen. I have used the monitor heavily (of course, it's a graphics monitor!) but this is an unprecedented level of poor manufacturing. I would not recommend buying given the frequency this seems to be happening with other customers.Really excellent display with very understated design and a beautiful panel. Along with being a beautiful PLS panel with excellent (although not perfect) viewing angles, ASUS included every cord you could imagine in the box (VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort) the stand is very smoothly adjusted, there is a rack along back to wrap cords through, and the display controls are minimal and very well done.

I have a new work laptop that requires me to use a KVM switch with this monitor. The KVM is a little older and doesn't support dual link DVI. OK, that's the KVM's problem, so I just used the KVM for the keyboard and mouse and plugged the laptop into the displayPort connector of the monitor. I use DVI for my main PC and displayPort for my work laptop. That works alright except after 2 hours the OSD goes to sleep under displayPort, no matter what. This puts the laptop to sleep and causes some annoying issues when I wake it about LAN timeouts. This didn't happen with the older 27"" monitor.

All but one or two of the stuck pixels were on or near the outer perimeter of the screen. As for the one dead pixel I have found it is a great panel! Unless you are trying hard to find it, it is absolutely unnoticeable. Color correction is great and the response time (4ms) is pretty good for a non TN panel.

I know a lot of professional/competitive First Person Shooter gamers want the awesome 120-144hz refresh rates but for a person who games just for the sheer enjoyment this monitor is great.

"637","First of all - no major cons. I am joining all the 5 stars reviews and there is not much I can add.Comes with DVI, HDMI (single not dual, but should support maximum resolution), Displayport, analogue. I checked all and all work. Maximum resolution is 2560x1440. Make sure  that your OS can drive the video card.My Zotac with AMD Radeon HD 6310 with Ubuntu 12.04 worked when I connected the cable.  My Zotac supports the native resolution only via DisplayPort. I could not drive more than 1920p via HDMI (the display should support this). I did not try to fix Xconf, but I read that it is possible. When you connect DisplayPort to the monitor make sure that you hear 'click' sound - took me half an hour to figure out why displayport does not work.I run the online test and this display is the best LCD I have ever owned, but this is not really hard because I always buy lower end. No dead pixels, no stuck pixels (I have bought open box product and there is always risk). The screen is just barely warm after hours of work. Comes with all cables. Adjusting monitor position is very easy and smooth, portrait mode - in one word excellent.To say that  27"" of real estate and 2.5K pixels is enormous (I am a software developer) is to say nothing at all. To really appreciate the display you should run some HD with deep black scenes.Display does decent job when in lower than native resolution. I would not work with text in not native resolution. Display does not support picture in picture mode (two PCs connected simultaneously) as some higher end displays do.I did not try any calibration and display comes with default 50s in the color settings (not calibrated).  I do not have required tools anyway to calibrate the display and the display looks very good as it is.Sound is decent, but not great.

They were in about 24 languages, which should cover most people.It came with a complete set of cables for four different types of inputs.  The power cable had no ""brick"" and was easy to plug in. The monitor stand is fully adjustable; it is possible to adjust both the height of the monitor and its viewing angle.I bought it to look at my extensive picture collection, taken with several high-resolution digital cameras.  The pictures look great!I have a few minor caveats, but not enough to deduct a star.1) It provides 2560x1440 resolution only with certain input types.  (There are four inputs.)  For example, some video cards do not support full resolution with HDMI inputs.  This monitor requires a capable video card. Check its specs before purchasing this monitor.2) Its inputs are located at the bottom of the monitor and video cable are hard to connect without bending them.There was no driver-installation disk with the monitor.  But it worked fine without a special driver.  I will look later for any driver or setup software.",1,9,8,10,90,10
"639","Excellent monitor with a excellent picture.  I connected my monitors with display port and hdmi, no issues at all.The biggest issue so far has been finding the best solution for all my needs and getting the two monitors to adjust to the same picture quality.In both cases it will take a little time to find the answer to both, so be willing to explore when you purchase this.",2,4,2,6,66.6666666666667,33.3333333333333
"640","I'll start my review by stating that there are a plethora of technical specs here on Amazon under the description, the other reviews, and the Q&As. Plus I'm not a big gamer or art designer, so some of the deep specs don't mean much to me.Basically I just wanted a huge monitor with > 1080p resolution for snapping documents and spreadsheets to either side of the monitor without losing much clarity. I hooked this up to my Dell laptop with the included DisplayPort adapter, and it immediately came up with the full 2560 x 1440 resolution. And it look phenomenal right out of the box.Having all the extra room has made my work so much easier. It's wonderful having so much room to work with.After checking out a dozen or so different monitors, comparing prices and reviews, I decided to take a shot with this one, and I'm so happy I did. There were no issues with shipping, and no dead pixels on start-up. This monitor has been perfect for me and my uses.",3,9,6,12,75,25
"641","This monitor is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. I have had no issues with this monitor the color is crisp and the quality is great. I have used this for FPS games as well as movies and have had no issues with input lag even though the response time is not the greatest. The stand is very good quality and I have had 0 issues with this monitor! Would recommend this to anyone that does general gaming, lots of computer work IE docs,websites, graphic design. This monitor is an all-purpose as far as I am concerned!",5,8,3,13,61.5384615384615,38.4615384615385
"642","I'm every bit as impressed with this display as I am with my 27"" iMac. The matte finish makes it much more usable in my opinion since it greatly cuts down on glare. I have it connected to a DisplayPort KVM switch and I have no trouble getting the maximum resolution from my mac book air and Windows 7 laptop as long as I use only DisplayPort components. My first shot using DisplayPort to DVI and DisplayPort to HDMI adapters was NOT successful. I really like the headphone jack on the display. By using DisplayPort as my output, I can set the display as my preferred audio device. As long as the display is connected to my speaker system through the headphone jack I can effectively use my KVM switch to also transmit audio. On the downside, the menu system takes some getting used to and something as simple as decreasing the brightness requires more button presses than I would like.",4,6,2,10,60,40
"643","Very happy with this monitor. Could use a few more calibration options, but the color is great. Definitely satisfied with my decision to get this instead of a Thunderbolt, though I love Apple products.",0,4,4,4,100,0
"644","I was looking for a monitor that I can use in vertical position mainly for reading and one that I can use for hours without eye fatigue. This monitor works just fine for me.Even though it uses PWM, different from most of the monitors in this price range, it has a high frequency PWM that is not noticable, hence puts no stress on your eyes after constant use for hours. But please note that I am not  so sensitive to flickering, so if you have a medical condition, situation can be different.Another important topic is the crisp screen. Since screens with heavy coating disperses the text, coating was one of the major critertia for me. This monitor has very light coating which preserves the sharpness of the text, also the existence of light coating is useful as it successfully avoids all non-major reflections.I have also watched movies and edited photos (although as an amateur) on this, and compared to my old laptop, colors are very vivid and natural. Although I have no idea what a professional photographer would think.I guess if you are looking for a monitor for long hours of reading and/or coding, for which vertical position is very useful, and also for one that you can use daily for watching movies and simple photo editing, in this price range, this is a very good alternative.",3,10,7,13,76.9230769230769,23.0769230769231
"645","Using this with my gaming PC. Most gamers I think use smaller monitors (24""?), but I am really enjoying this one. Brilliant clarity. Because of the limitations of the games I play and of my graphics card (Gigabyte GeForce GTX 970 G1 Gaming GDDR5 Pcie Video Graphics Card, 4GB), I use this at 1080p. The card is not quite up to pushing 4k pixels around, to FPS drops way down to unacceptable levels for a good game experience.",2,4,2,6,66.6666666666667,33.3333333333333
"646","Don't get me wrong; this is an amazing monitor. From the quality build to the sheer screen size, and crisp colors. However, I noticed a group of dead pixels on my monitor, a bit right of the center. VERY noticeable when doing anything on a white screen, which nowadays, is basically everything, especially when browsing the internet. I was very disappointed, and sent it in for a replacement. I will upgrade the stars if the next one comes with no dead pixels. Looking forward to Friday!",4,3,-1,7,42.8571428571429,57.1428571428571

I don't recommend purchasing these if you do any sort of graphic design / photography work or anything where colors are important.",1,4,3,5,80,20
"648","I like this monitor but there are a few things I was displeased with. The height is adjustable but cannot be lowered all the way. There will be 3 inches showing below the frame at the lowest height. Also, there is no audio-out (headphone) port! I connected my xbox 360 to the monitor via HDMI and the audio would enter the monitor through HDMI and play through the built in speakers but I couldn't connect to my external speakers! Lots of adapters are included in this purchase, but the most useful adapter, HDMI, is not included! Why??There is a bit of noticeable ghosting but this is expected with IPS monitors. With a bit of tweaking the ghosting can be diminished. Do some research of whether IPS is the right choice for you. All in all, the stand is VERY study and the still picture image is amazing. There is minimal glare and the matte black frame is sexy.",5,6,1,11,54.5454545454545,45.4545454545455
"649","I love this display. The features and specs at this price beat all other options and brands at the time of my purchase. Despite lack of any reviews and ratings at the time, I am very glad I took the risk and purchased this product.The adjustable stand is very mice and solid. The speakers aren't the best, but good enough for general use (for watching video or listening to music I switch the output to my mini bookshelf audio system).The USB hub functionality is pretty handy. I'm only using the 2 ports hidden under/behind the display. One for a wireless mouse dongle and the other for a Bluetooth dongle. The reason I chose this arrangement is that there won't be any additional cables running out of the monitor, and the dongles will be closer to what they are communicating with with less obstacles in between (compared to when plugged to the back of the computer case).I initially found the color a bit too warm compared to my older Dell display (which sits next to it now), but later discovered that actually that is the more accurate color. I later learned that LCDs tend to be a bit bluish in color and since my eyes were used to that the new ASUS felt a bit too warm. This was confirmed when bought a screen calibrator, and calibrated both displays. The ASUS was much closer to the current calibrated state (I do a lot of photo editing in Lightroom, that's why I eventually decided to get a calibrator)I should also mention that the buttons on the front bezel may not look very attractive if you look at the pictures, but that's because of the lighting which accentuates the buttons. In practice you cannot even tell that the buttons are there.Overall, a great product. And I would absolutely recommend it to anyone.",2,15,13,17,88.2352941176471,11.7647058823529

"654","As others have said the uniformity of the display isn't spectacular. The bottom right corner of my display is brighter and suffers from some sort of light spillage. However after calibrating the display and reducing the brightness to a reasonable level the issue was significantly improved. I use a color calibrator and as usual the factory default on this monitor is about twice as bright as it should be for any sort of serious graphics work. I see no dead pixels, viewing angle is good, size is perfect, and the extra resolution over a 1080p monitor is absolutely fantastic.",3,10,7,13,76.9230769230769,23.0769230769231
"655","The resolution is sharp at 4k but the BLACK is not as BLACK as others have noted.  Ok, the final on this I had to return it.  I don't love it.

Another annoying thing is when it goes to sleep the open app windows squeeze into one corner.  Very annoying.",2,4,2,6,66.6666666666667,33.3333333333333
"656","Positive: Beautiful monitor, especially for the price. No dead pixels. The stand is high quality, and every cord I could need was supplied.Negative: The speakers are cheap, and they mysteriously broke on mine. This isn't a big issue for me since I have spare computer speakers and didn't plan on using the integrated speakers anyway.I have no surge protector on this monitor, so I suppose it's possible a surge destroyed the speakers. It might also be possible that someone else turned the volume all the way up and thusly broke them. All I know is they were working and then they weren't, and the monitor is only a few weeks old. When I next turned the computer on, the volume was all the way up. So it might well be that someone else broke the speakers by turning them too high. Regardless, the monitor is perfectly usable for my needs, sound turned to zero on the monitor.",7,6,-1,13,46.1538461538462,53.8461538461538

I really wanted to make use of this card and really just running stuff at 1920x1080 wasn't pushing my graphics card.  I was thinking of doing a 3 monitor setup but instead I decided to go with a WQHD monitor.  This monitor has stayed on top now for a couple years and even though Dell has some newer models coming out and some 4k monitors are coming out now I felt 1440p was a good resolution for my needs.I get the added benefit of also having a great display for photo editing which I do a ton of.I have had no issues with the monitor and aside from calibrating it myself which I would have done with any monitor I got anyways it was very easy to connect up.  I also was impressed that it came with every connection cable under the sun in the box.  So no matter which of the connection methods you use to hook to your graphics card you don't need to buy a cable.  I'm using Displayport as I have a Samsung 1080p 27"" monitor as a second monitor hooked up to HDMI.",1,6,5,7,85.7142857142857,14.2857142857143

The screen's ability to rotate 90* and orient vertically is also very useful! Highly recommend this monitor!",0,2,2,2,100,0
"659","It's not very often I buy a computer component over $400, and it's not very often I write a review on amazon... But after hooking this monitor up last night, I am just blown away. Fantastic viewing angles, the resolution is breath taking, and 60hz refresh at native res is smooth. Has one dead pixel in the bottom right corner, but I'm honestly not going to worry about it, especially since some other people were having issues getting a monitor with fewer than 3 dead pixels. It's out of the way and having one dead out of 3686400 pixels is pretty alright with me.The stand is very sturdy and does not feel like it will fall over, my brother bought a different brand monitor and is scared every time he bumps his desk. Hah! Should have bought ASUS :).No complaints so far!",9,7,-2,16,43.75,56.25

After a few months, the volume on-screen-display would not go away. So I RMA'd the monitor. The replacement that I got has a severe backlight bleed issue about a quarter of the way across the bottom. This monitor is basically useless for anything dark. I believe the lcd panel itself isn't correctly formed. By pushing lightly on the screen panel near the bleed, it makes a popping sound like the screen is warped.

People in prior reviews said the print was to small you read, you can easily adjust this by pressing Ctrl and + at the same time to increase print size in your browser window.For people who do picture/video editing the black part of your picture or video will be TRULY black and not dark grey like I have seen in other monitors.  I have an eye for color and I can see the littlest difference in color so accurate colors is REALLY important to me.  I found the color calibration on this monitor to be very easy to do and I did NOT use any software to calibrate the color.  I did all the color calibration by eye.Also this monitor was very well packaged and was easy to setup.  All you have to do is attach the stand to the back of the monitor by screwing  in a few screws and you are done.

It's just not worth it to use an old crappy monitor while I send this back, the shipping, the repacking, the hassle, etc. It really is a beautiful viewing experience overall for a cheap price! After another 2-3 years I'll probably buy another cheap video card and get a 4k monitor when they're at reasonable prices and hopefully well over 30 inches.",8,8,0,16,50,50

Then after 3 weeks of regular use, it just stopped recognizing any inputs and stubbornly insists that there is no signal coming in.  Tried replacing cables, plugging and unplugging, using different inputs, and testing with other computers, but no luck.  So given the overall experience this is decidedly a 1 star product.I am attempting to initiate the return process now.** UPDATE **After a huge hassle going through ASUS's support channels, they finally authorized me to ship the monitor to their repair center.  I spent some time packing this giant up and sending it off in a box that I felt confident I would never see again.  After waiting about 3 weeks with no idea what was happening and no means of tracking progress, to my mild surprise it finally did return in a similar box, and since then it has been working absolutely great!  Sound still sucks, but as I said previously, that is not really important.  The picture is great, that is what matters.

"717","This monitor is bright, consistent, and flexible.  It's a near optimal size for desktop work and even near-room video viewing.  Picture quality is near perfect, including color rendition (there is a more expensive color-corrected ""A"" series for professional use, but this model has the truest colors out of the box I've ever seen).  The monitor is responsive, or at least looks that way when the younger user plays his flying and shooting games via ATI Radeon.The monitor pivots, swivels, tilts, and rotates, which means you can change the horizontal viewing angle, vertical angle, height, and rotate the screen.  My previous experience with rotating screens was on 4:3 aspect ratio models, on which portrait mode was perfect for document composition and some spreadsheet work.  The 16:9 rotated mode is more narrow, and in portrait mode it's long, long trip visually from top to bottom.  For document work, my personal preference is to stay in landscape.  One specific nicety is the ability to fit 100 mint.com transactions in one screen, at native resolution.The menu system offers a huge number of range of color, brightness, and other adjustments.  One minor quibble is that the on-screen adjustment menus are not the easiest to navigate, but I find I rarely if ever have a need to access those controls. The monitor wakes up, syncs, and works consistently on both analog and digital inputs.

"718","First, I will say that I'm an Asus fan. Typically their products are top notch and will fulfill your needs nicely. This monitor is their first attempt to compete with Dell's Ultrasharp IPS line while providing a better price for consumers. I was torn between the Dell 2713U and this monitor. After looking at prices and reviews I decided to save money and give this monitor a shot. The first one received had one stuck pixel and one dead pixel with excessive back light bleed from the upper right corner. But, thanks to Amazon's awesome return policy and the fact that Asus has a zero dead pixel policy, I quickly received another one about three days later. The second one was good to go with no pixel issues and the backlight bleed was better than the first. The construction is solid and the button controls easy to use with a switch on the fly function between modes (i.e. Theater, Scenic mode...etc.) The stand is pretty functional with adequate adjustability. I was thinking this would be a huge monitor on my desk but it turned out that I probably could have gone with a 30 inch : ( Oh well, I still am enjoying it and it was an improvement over my 24 inch TN panel. Although the color, clarity and resolution are not quite up to par with Dell's IPS panels, it does have a slightly faster response time and for $300 savings more than adequate color, clarity and resolution for me. Just think of the games I can buy with that $300 savings! : ) It also comes with the digital video input (DVI) cables which is nice. All in all, I would say if you have the money to burn go with the Dell. But, if your looking to save some doe and still have a solid upgrade just a step down from the Dell, look no further and pick up the PB278Q. Keep improving Asus and you will grab the trophy!",8,25,17,33,75.7575757575758,24.2424242424242

But it is still an excellent display in its own right.Now I was a bit worried, after reading some reviews on the internet, that it might have too much Input Lag or would flicker too much due to the PWM back-light.  But neither of those things are a significant factor because of my setup.Input lag might be more of a factor if I was running games at lower frame-rates.  But at 60fps or above its just not noticeable.  To eliminate the Back-light as a factor I simply bumped it up one notch to 100%, which means its on all the time, so it doesn't flicker.  Then I adjust the display through my video card's settings.  Note: this does cause it to use more electricity - 44W compared to ~24W at 50% brightness (which is rather dark IMHO).  But since this is replacing a display that consumed ~110W I consider 44W to be negligible.The Good points:High Resolution and Fairly large size.Bright display with Good Colors and Viewing Angles.Nice Range of physical adjustments; Tilt, Swivel, Height... etc.Solid Construction and doesn't wobble around.The Bad points:Price!  ~$700 is still allot of money.Some will miss extra USB ports (I do not).Some will also fault the OSD for lacking features.

The deal breaker was the text quality for me.My usage is primarily text editing, I want something crisp and easy on my eyes.Compared to my 27"" (2k) Apple IPS panel I am using at work, the contrast and the sharpness of text was looked inferior to me.I expected that the higher resolution would translate to excellent text quality, but it seemed a bit fuzzy and out of focus for me, esp. black text on white background.  I spent a day trying to tweak the settings, but could not get to a happy place.  The blacks were just not blackenough for me.  I did like the height/angle/swivel  adjustable stand.  Hated the adjustment buttons.Did not come with a Thunderbolt cable.My conclusion:  A 4k resolution panel in the 27-30"" range does not make much sense for a business user.  (Perhaps an expnsive IPS variant would work better). The high pixel count imposes severe demands on the video card, and you will have to accept a lesser quality panel technology.

Fantastic color, no pixel problems.My issue with it is that it will randomly turn off, and then sometimes get stuck in a boot cycle where it will not re-display the image for 1-2 minutes.

By the next day at UPS's normal delivery time at my house, I had my new monitor.  Turn around time was 26 hours.  Way to go Amazon!!!!The monitor gives excellent graphics.  Neither one had any dead pixels.  There is only one annoying thing about it that prevents me from giving it a 5 rating.  I usually run it via the HDMI input.  If the monitor loses the signal from the video card, the monitor automatically reverts to VGA mode and does not remember that I set it for HDMI.  So if I forget to shut off the monitor before I shut off the computer, or if I restart the computer or if I set the video card to shut off after a certain amount of time, I have to go to the button on the monitor and cycle through inputs again.

It is an AWS product, so this was completely expected. Everything inside was packaged well and nothing was rattling around. There was a scratch on the stand that I was not too happy about. The monitor itself was perfect. No dead pixels.Picture Quality - This was perfect. The screen is matte and has no reflections which makes it very good for work. The color is pretty good. The contrast leaves a bit to be desired though. For work, greys and whites tend to blend together and with the increased real estate of 4k, you see a lot more white than you're used to.Living with 4k - A lot of reviews mention small fonts. That is to be expected. There are some adjustments needed. [...] That link tells you how to make your fonts bigger. Set it to 150% and you'll get same sized fonts at a much better quality. The other problem is not all programs respect Windows' setting, so some programs might still display smaller fonts.Overall happy so far.",4,14,10,18,77.7777777777778,22.2222222222222

I had a good PC so when I saw this, I thought why not buy it, it isn't expensive.Main thing I was worried about was, can I run games at 4K? So I made a smart decision, if I can't run a game on 4K, I'd use 1440p. If I can't even at 1440p, I'd use 1080p. Why between 4K, 1440p and 1080p? Because they all have the same screen ratio. So no blurring or starching of the pixels when you use any of them (Yes I can confirm this)I have SLI-GTX980 and a Intel i7 2600K and I've been able to play these games on 4K:GTA V / Dragon Age Inquisition / Batman Akrham Origins / Batman Arkham City / Civ 5 / Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes / and some others...The rest I've been playing on 1440p like:The Witcher 3 / Battlefield Hardline / Arma 3 / and othersAs for outside of gaming. Its just so awesome. The desktop becomes huge and has so much space that you can put so many windows opened with a good size and still fit well. I study Computer Science so this helps me a lot when doing assignment. I'd have the program opened, a web that has what I need to do opened, a web with some tutorial opened, and a video recorded from my instructor opened.

"848","A couple months ago, I decided to upgrade some parts in my computer. I bought a new power supply, gpu, extra ram and wanted to upgrade my monitor as well. I had a Dell 21"" display that came with my computer when i first bought it and it still worked beautifully but i wanted to get a bigger size and I loved the idea of it being able to adjust height. My boyfriend recently ordered the Asus PA248Q and I loved how the height adjusted and the general look of the monitor. I wasn't thrilled with reviews of the Asus brand or the complaints on customer service but I saw this monitor for $160 ""like new"" from Amazon warehouse so i went for it. I used my boyfriends amazon prime account(this account) for fast shipping and it arrived beautifully! The ""like new"" description said small scratches on the stand, back and sides but I couldn't spot any areas of damage. There were no dead pixels or scratches on the screen so I was happy! I am not an expert on monitor specs but this met my size needs, had great picture and worked great!I got this monitor at the beginning of Jan 2015. It is now March 9th and about two weeks ago when i turned my computer on, the monitor had reset the color options and my monitor had an extreme red tint to it. I couldn't figure out what was going on and anytime i went into the menu settings to try to adjust it the color, it kept resetting, It went green then looked purple and was so dark from 0 contrast that i could hardly see what i was doing. None of the color temp presets or mode settings worked right. They would all have one color set to 100% with the others at 0 or they would all be at zero. We tested my boyfriends monitor on my computer and everything seemed fine. Then we tried my monitor on his computer as well and the color looked fine so we were stumped. We were concerned the gpu might be malfunctioning after a google search of similar issues suggested that but it didn't make sense since his monitor worked just fine. I googled what to set my RGB and contrast too for the best picture and then i went into user mode and manually set my colors to r- 95, g- 90, b- 90, contrast- 100 and brightness at around 60+ since I don't like it extremely bright and everything looked beautiful again. I was worried turning it off would reset it but it turned on and worked fine again...For about a week.......now EVERY time i boot up my computer the monitor settings have reset themselves to all zeros. It has been about 5 days of manually setting all the colors so i can use my computer. It is an easy fix and its annoying but i don't mind since I don't have any other issues. If it starts resetting itself while i am using my computer, then we will have a problem. I am really hoping it never gets to that point but you never know. I haven't bothered calling Asus since their support is supposed to be horrendous and I really don't want to spend an arm and a leg shipping it out to be repaired so i am hoping for the best. Monitors are really expensive and I got a great deal on this one and I am hoping it wont need to be replaced anytime soon but i would also love if it would stop resetting itself every reboot. I will leave the review at 3 stars for now and hope I don't have to lower it.Pros: Solid heavy stand, no light bleed, no dead pixels, height adjusts, monitor tilts to portrait (if you care about that, i never use it)Cons: color settings reset every boot, built in speakers (i leave them muted since i have speakers on my desk and didn't buy this for the speakers)I hope this was helpful in your decision!",18,33,15,51,64.7058823529412,35.2941176470588

I bought this for my photoshop work and watch high resolution movies / games, however it doesnt serve me well since the color are horriblely presented due to the screen bleed. Also i noticed some performance issue in terms of dropping FPS, i don't think it's my computer related because when i watch high resolution video, my 1920 monitor works fine however on this 2560x1440 monitor sometimes video will delay, which won't match up the audio(using dual link DVI with GTX680/ 3930x@4.5ghz).

Plus the camera does not have a microphone.  So I went with this one and I am very happy.  I wish it were 24"" also but they did not make this monitor as a 24"".

The only minor drawback I find is that the black isn't solid black by a longshot (lights off, the black screen has various shades of gray/tint, but nothing terrible).

"874","I got my Asus PB287Q 4k monitor yesterday and started using it with my Mac Pro (Late 2013). Let me tell you: I am blown away. I used it with Aperture and colours, contrast, etc. seem all to work out of the box. There is a reason, why this screen got top ratings by Tomshardware.com.Nevertheless, a few issues arise with fine-tuning the resolution, hence the 4 stars:- If used alone, I get a max resolution of 3200x1800 @ 30Hz.- If I switch to DP1.2 in the monitor preferences, I get max 3840x2160 @ 60Hz, but then I get tearing/artefacts on the right hand side of the screen (apparently this is an Apple problem and is going to be resolved in 10.10), but effectively is useless- The only way to get max resolution of 3840x2160 @ 30Hz is to plug in an additional Full HD monitor via HDMI (I am not joking!)- There is no startup screen on the Asus (not really bothered by this)Update:After a week with the monitor, I have managed to get the max resolution at 30Hz: I used a mini DP to HDMI cable, rather than the mini DP to DP 1.2 cable.Consensus on the web is, that the tearing is a driver related issue, as people who have started up from Windows on the Mac Pro (via Bootcamp) do not have the tearing issue. When I chatted w/ Apple Support, they stated. that 4k was still in its infancy and I should be seeing improvements in the not too distant future.Thanks to Amazon support who sent me a replacement, as it was not initially clear if it was a monitor related issue (hadn't found any other information on the 3800 x 1800 resolution and was able to replicate it with the replacement unit).In the end, I decided to keep the monitor. The resolution is awesome, the stand is the best for these screens (compared to the other brands which use the same panel) and the Asus menu is very straight forward.LL",7,10,3,17,58.8235294117647,41.1764705882353

I got a POP sound a couple times and a few times the screen flashed these horizontal white bands. The bottom corners were very bright in game, washed out colors as well. This wasn't even running the game @4k but rather 1440p.I decided to return this monitor. It's just not worth it even as this price, for me. I'd rather wait for a good screen and prices to drop.

Bigger is better!  My resolution is set to 1920x1080.  I tried 2560x1440 (need to use the display port cable) but everything was too small and hard to read.  Another thing to note about the display port cable, when I initially tried it, I didn't get any signal.  The solution turned out to be as simple as swapping the cable ends.  I took the end that was plugged into the monitor and plugged it into my video card and vice versa.Out of the box the brightness was set very high.  I had to dial it down to around 30.  But the image quality is very nice.  My only complaint is for the premium price this monitor sells for, I expected higher build quality.  This thing is mostly all plastic, and it doesn't seem like the sturdy kind.  My old 20"" Dell monitor all-around seemed built better and the on/off switch on it eventually gave out after 7 years of use.

The Asus HDMI cable wouldn't fit in my graphics card; the graphics card's HDMI connector has 2 beveled edges while the ASUS cable has only one.  I discovered that I had an unused HDMI cable plugged into my tv and it has the 2 beveled edges so I connected the monitor with that using the monitor's Display Port input.  That ended up being worse that connecting it with DVI?!  With Display Port the display was shrunk down and had a 1 inch black border around it.  So back to DVI I went.  Plus, with the Display Port connected the text was definitely blurry.  With DVI it's sharp.The USB hub in the monitor is USB 2, not USB 3.  So if you're connecting to a USB 3 on your pc you'll lose the advantages of USB 3.The speakers are really crummy sounding.  I'm using some ancient inexpensive Altec Lansing PC speakers (7 in / 18 cm high) that I've had for decades and they sound much better than the monitor's speakers.

I'm not sure if it's accurate enough to use for graphic design or editing where color sensitivity is crucial, as I've not delved that deep into its accuracy, but for casual use and gaming it's plenty fine for my tastes, at least compared to prior monitors - white is no longer a tinge of yellow.  Viewing angle is great as well.Quality control, however, wasn't as good - and is the reason for 4 stars rather than 5.

"1039","Update: 11/26/14:  Okay, I have built my PC system and have everything working.  As far as running this monitor from the PC side of things.  It's excellent.  The color is balanced, the text is sharp and pronounced, and everything just pops on the screen.  The text is still a little small, but with the correct settings in Windows, everything is perfect.  I would give this monitor 5 stars with the exception of one thing... It does not work out of the box when building your own PC system (at least when pairing this monitor with a Gigabyte X97-Gaming GT motherboard.The first night of my build, I installed everything in my case (Motherboard, CPU, Ram, etc), plugged my Display Port cable into my motherboard directly (using discrete graphics) and booted up.  Nothing (only a black screen with a blinking cursor).  Tried several things thinking it was my build.. After an hour, I decided to plug my computer into my TV using a HDMI port.  Voila... The screen came up perfectly.  For some reason this monitor does not work well with the Gigabyte Bios setup when using discrete graphics.  Long story short, after installing windows, and then installing my two GTX 970 graphics cards everything worked well (BIOS shows up correctly as well as all resolutions that I need).In the end, this is a fantastic monitor... My original one star review was based on my experience with my MacBook Pro (which if you have a 2012 model, you may be disappointed).  Otherwise, if you are thinking about a lower resolution monitor, I'd recommend this one in an instance (as long as you know how to fiddle with a few things to get it working).Update 11/2014:  I have updated my initial review from one star to 3 based on some information that I obtained from another Asus user.  It appears that this monitor does work the the MacBook Pro at 60 hz, just not the first Macbook Pro Retina.  I plan on building my PC system this weekend and I will see how this monitor performs on the PC side.  If everything looks good, I'll re-visit this review and update the stars as necessary.  As of now, despite the MacBook issue, I still feel that this monitor is a little washed out, and the viewing angles are not perfect, but this may change on the PC side.Original Review: According to the documentation on Asus' website, this monitor will work with a MacBook Pro Retina in 60 Hz.  However, no matter how much I try, I am only able to get 30 Hz (and my mac indicates that the picture is in low resolution mode).  Frankly, this monitor actually looks terrible.  I'm unable to find a viewing angle that brings out rich color.  Everything looks washed out unless I really tilt the monitor in a very exaggerated angle. The worst part is that the screen is extremely small and barely readable.  In order to properly see text, I have to change the resolution or magnify the text (in Microsoft Word / Safari) which caused everything to look jagged or pixelated.  Nothing is crisp. I also want to comment on how terrible the controls are on this screen.  You have to cup your hands behind the monitor to make adjustments (I turned off the monitor several times by accidentally hitting the wrong button because there is no real guide to what you're selecting).I'm giving the monitor one star for having a good stand.",8,24,16,32,75,25

For example when the DP goes to sleep, and the HDMI is active. When the DP wakes up it doesn't automatically switch back. Have to do that manually every time.  And the last currently minor but still annoying is the monitor occasionally going briefly to blank and then back. It happened more with the original cable and the 60 Hz setting. Changing both (30 Hz) helped, but it still happens now and then.",1,4,3,5,80,20
"1057","For the price, this is a superb monitor. I really love how ridiculously accurate the colors are. Images simply look more 3D on this monitor compared to my old TN panel because color gradients are properly displayed and the dynamic range on each individual color is not compressed.My only gripe is that there's no audio output for the HDMI, which means you can't, for example, use your XBOX 360 with your main speakers. The internal speakers are predictably pathetic although output is reasonable considering they're basically laptop speakers.If I had to nitpick, yes, the bleed through the lower right hand corner from the power LED can be annoying, but it's not noticeable under most circumstances.Viewing angles are not impressive, honestly. The colors change slightly very quickly off center. No better than any other monitor I've used, of course, TN panels have also gotten pretty good in recent years and come up to the level of IPS screens.Base is way better quality than I expected. Heavy, excellent construction. Swivel, tilt, height, and 90° rotational adjustments.

"1058","I recently purchased two of these for use with my Dell laptop (dual screen, extended desktop setup).  They are replacing two 10 year old Dell 1600x1200 flat panel monitors.  I loved those Dells, but I wanted something bigger.  I also considered buying Dell's 27"" WQHD monitors, but went with these ASUS ones instead primarily because they were 12% cheaper and they seemed to be very comparable in quality.I've been using my ASUS monitors for a week now and I love them.  The colors look great and the matte finish eliminates all glare.  As a computer programmer, I don't care at all about getting perfect ""calibrated"" color.  The colors look great to me--same as my old Dells.The built in speakers are nice because I can now get rid of my cheapo computer speakers which are ugly and take up desk space.  The monitor's speakers are 3W, which seems to be sufficient for my purposes (listening to music while I sit and work at my desk).The monitor stands are solid and they in position when you set them (my old Dell's would often slide to the lowest position).  The monitor stand's tilt and rotate works great.  I do wish they would raise up a bit higher.  Also, the swivel function is a little bit ghetto.  You basically have to rotate the whole base (though there is a mechanism that reduces friction to make this easier to do).These monitors do NOT have a USB built-in (my old Dells did).  This is a bummer to me, but it's a problem that I fixed easily by purchasing an external hub fo ~$15.  Now, I have the hub (slightly) cluttering my desk, but that takes up much less space that the speakers that I don't need anymore, now that I use the ones built into the monitor.I have my PC hooked into the DisplayPort ports and I recently bought a TV tuner box and hooked that up to the HDMI port on one of the monitors.  It works great, and it's really nice that I get both the picture and sound out of the monitor.Overall great monitor.  I love them.",6,18,12,24,75,25

I really want to keep this screen and enjoy its resolution and functionality, but if I get one more monitor with a bad pixel, I'm looking elsewhere.  I've literally had enough spending my gas money to drive these huge boxes back to the mail box time after time because of poor quality.  ASUS, this doesn't seem so isolated, you've got a manufacturing issue.  Also please figure out what the grey spots that keep popping up behind the pixel layer are, they are also extremely distracting.",5,5,0,10,50,50

I realized I cannot play FPS games less than 120Hz without getting motion sickness. However slower paced games should play good on this monitor.-No G sync. However V sync does help out a lot. IMO 4K monitors will not be worth getting unitl they support G sync-Popping noise when monitor is powered on.Conclusion.- I returned the monitor and will probably get the ROG Swift instead. ASUS did a good job with this monitor. I would not mind picking up the monitor again when it supports G sync. If you play slower paced games where 60Hz is fine this monitor would be good for you. They also need to find out what the deal with the popping noise is.  IMO wait until 4K monitors support Gsync.",6,14,8,20,70,30

Problem solved by hooking up a PC speaker system, or sending it over to my receiver.Most importantly, these come with all the cables for the connections on the monitors!

"1109","Assuming you don't have to mess with Asus's infamously weak customer support, this is a terrific buy. Hard to get a screen this good, this size, at this price. It's weak on controls, imo, but runs sRGB and adobeRGB and provides a really good pictue, with very good colors. Right out of the box the pic is too bright and too hot but once you set it to sRGB, it's great. The GtoG time of 5ms is fine for watching videos (streaming or otherwise). Some gamers might want faster but this isn't really a gamer's screen -- more for vids and pro photographers, and such.Asus id a great job of putting together a high quality, pro-class 27"" monitor with 2560x1440 res for less than $800. Asus did this by using Samsung's PLA technology, which would have made it a very expensive screen except that Asus cut back a few corners to hold the price down. For $800 or less, this is hard to beat.Biggest drawback is it doesn't provide a USB hub but you can get USB hubs any day of the week and cheaply, so it shouldn't bother omost folks that you don't have one built into the monitor--after all, a USB hub on a monitor is not screen relevent-- it'd just be another hub for usb. But for screen relevent ports, this one has them all, and comes with cords for each.It's not a glare screen with a mirroring-smooth finish, so it won't look as sharp as a glare screen.

I brought this monitor Oct 2, 2013 and its been  getting used just about 24 hours a day sense then. That said if you have the extra 60 to 70 dollars to spend I would recommend the Dell UltraSharp U2713HM. The Dell UltraSharp U2713HM is a more balance monitor in terms of overall professional use Photoshop etc. and it also has more calibrating setting options. The ASUS PB278Q is tilted a little bit more toward the gaming side of things as far as overall performance is concerned but is definitely no slouch when it comes to overall professional use especially once calibrated reproducing some of the most accurate colors of any monitor. Uncalibrated however the sRBG mode will be the most accurate out of the box.Cons:No remoteVolume and menu buttons don't light up on the monitor.Speakers are tinyASUS combined the volume up button with the brightness control button.In order to turn the volume up or down one must first touch the volume down button and then touch the volume up button.

I bought this monitor for the crisp look i'll get while gaming, and while gaming man does it look sharp. Just beautiful really. But I never realized how much I use my pc for lots of other things besides gaming until I bought this monitor. The high resolution makes day to day tasks a bit obnoxious, with everything being really small on screen. You can bump up scaling, but then it makes text look fuzzy, which then defeats why you bought a 4k monitor haha.It's an unfortunate case of having your cake, and wanting to eat it too. Hopefully things will smooth out, but lets just say I haven't gotten rid of my 1080p panel yet.",6,8,2,14,57.1428571428571,42.8571428571429

It comes and goes at random frequency, making the monitor useless. Searching the reviews, l found someone else had the exactly same problem after months of use. The LCD itself looks OK. It must be a bad control circuit.Too bad I purchased a second one just last month.Update. The second one we bought also starts showing problems after a little over a year.

There's was nothing special about the price, except it's now selling for $50 more than when I bought it 1 week ago.One important thing to note is that you might need to create a custom resolution to get the full 2560x1440 resolution.I have a GeForce video card and was surprised this resolution wasn't already available. After setting up a custom resolution with the card's software I found the screen flickering. The flickering went away after I reduced the image quality with the card's software. I didn't buy the monitor to play games so quality setting didn't have any effect on the quality of what I'm using the monitor for.When I restart my computer nothing will display on the monitor. Getting it operational again is an inconsistent process. I might have to resetup the resolution and setup the monitor extend option again, or use the DVI instead of the HDMI, or something else. I'm really working too hard to make this work.Make sure your video card can easily handle 2560x1440 before you buy this.",4,3,-1,7,42.8571428571429,57.1428571428571

"1337","I purchased this monitor to do web development and design work from my home. I'm used to using mac stuff: monitors and systems – always nice and always expensive (provided for by the companies I've worked for).I read about some of the inconsistencies of the Asus PB279Q, but was impressed by the reviews, features and price tag. So, I decided to give it a shot. Here are my arbitrary ratings when comparing it to some of the other gear I've used:Color: 8/10Clarity: 8/10Brightness: 8/10Newsflash: it doesn't feel like a $1000+ apple cinema display. It's not as sharp, bright and certainly doesn't render the color the same way. But for the price, the asus is pretty darn good. I think it's fine for professional photo editing and graphics, but (like i said) not the best.Problems: Yes, if I had to do it again, I might steer clear. The monitor I received has a very slight, but noticeable darkness to the bottom edge of the screen. I'm sending it back to Amazon for a replacement. I'll let you know if the next one is better. I think many people might not even care about the darkness, but I do. I attempted to take a photo to illustrate, but it doesn't really do it justice. You will be able to tell from the photo that there is a degree of variance and spotting to the overall brightness. In other words: there are dark spots and bright spots.",6,15,9,21,71.4285714285714,28.5714285714286

"1350","I would have given this monitor a 5 if the setup hadn't depended on the fact that I'm a very experienced engineer and software developer.I'm lately working as a software developer and wanted this monitor because of the 2560x1440 resolution.  I'm using an Asus ASUS X75A-DS51 and as anyone who uses a laptop will tell you, it's not necessarily so that a laptop can drive one of these hi-res monitors.So I contacted the manufacturer of the laptop and they informed me that the laptop has integrated Intel HD-4000 video graphics.  That means I can't change the graphics card.  The manufacturer also informed me that they couldn't find anything specific to the laptop that specifies the maximum resolution of the video graphics.  (The laptop's resolution is 1600x900 for the built in display.)  However the manufacturer was able to direct me to the Intel website where Intel specifies that the HD 4000 graphics will drive a 2560x1440 monitor. See: [...] So I bought the monitor on that basis and with particularly high hopes because both the laptop and monitor are manufactured by Asus.This monitor comes with an HDMI (and other cables), so I plugged it into my laptop.  The laptop could drive the monitor, but only at 1920x1200 (I think it was), not the full resolution even with the latest video driver from Asus.  This sent me on a long, long google-goose chase.  I actually found a way to set a custom resolution using the Intel Graphics and Media Control Panel application that comes with the laptop.  One has to accept the disclaimer that this might wreck the chips in the computer, or the monitor, but I think that's not likely because the monitor and chipset do both claim this resolution.Bottom line, this actually worked great.  I""m very happy with the monitor.  No bright single pixels that are forever on, at least no obvious ones.  I'm very finicky, so this means the monitor has nothing to distract my eye.Finally I'm posting notes I've written to myself about where I got all this information.  It's pretty cryptic, but I don't have time to do much more.  If you actually need this information, there is enough here to get you though setting up the monitor.Create a ""Custom Resolution"" in the ""Intel Graphics and Media Control Panel"" app.  Select Display=Asus PB278 Digital Television, with Basic Settings:Width=2560, Height=1440 32bit, 55p Hz  Timing=CV8-RBObtained from posting by finGer on Dec 2, 2013 4:50 PM on :the site: [...]with screensnap at: [...]I used to have a manager who used to say ""NT CBS BP""- that is to say, ""nothing that can't be solved by programming.""

"1444","My Use Case: I'm a Web Developer / Designer and I recently purchased a 2012 Mac Pro with the intent of building a mega rig with at least 3 displays, with the option to do more and it not cost more than a nice car.I bought 2 refurb . open box displays.  They were packaged differently and actually came via two different couriers. Initially they seemed smaller than I thought, but it's mostly because the bezel is so small.  The screen is exactly the same size as my Apple 27"" Cinema Display.  When first setting up the menus are a bear, but once you figure out that the buttons sort of work like the ATM buttons (labels are displayed above each button) it makes sense.  It comes with plenty of cables, very nice.  Display port, HDMI and a DVI to hdmi adapter.  The stands are very nice, easy to adjust, I recommend turning them 90 degrees to plug in your connections, then rotate back.4k Displays are new to me.  I first plugged one into the Mini Display Port of my gt120 graphics card that comes stock with many Mac Pros.  And to my surprise it will run it as full resolution!  However, that's almost impossible to use, everything is too small.  It would also  run it at 1080p HiDPi mode as well.  This is where the interface is like a 1080p display, but the text, photos, and edges are all rendered at full resolution.  I fought with Switch ResX hoping to get a better display mode, but no luck, and even still I was only getting 30hz.  So I bought a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 . This card is perfect for these displays, it has 3 Display Ports and will drive all of the display modes, I'm running a 3008 x 1692 HiDPi mode right now.Only complaint would be the speakers, garbage, utter garbage... but I bought a display, not speakers.  I'm not even removing a star for that.  Asus, great job on these, they are pro quality IMHO.",4,15,11,19,78.9473684210526,21.0526315789474

"1455","Physically, I like the design. I thought this would be a great monitor. The image quality is nice. What's not nice is the annoying buttons on the back. No labels and no dedicated buttons for anything. Once you do figure out which buttons do what, it's hard to push the tge corect buttons from any slightly off angle since they're on the back, and not super far apart! You would think with so many inputs, this monitor would have a dedicated source button. Or at least work well with multiple sources via auto switch based on signal or something. Nope. My old super cheap Asus display as well as other recent less expensive Asus models have the dedicated button, but not this one. Huge minus if you need to switch sources frequently.Aside from annoyance, the monitor malfunctioned pretty much constantly. I spent hours trying to work the kinks out. Essentially if I switched to my second computer, the thing would freak out for a while. It would act like no signal was found until I power cycled it a few times. I tried different cable options: Display port and hdmi..to no avail. When the freak out would happen, I'd also be unable to use the menu to manually switch sources, it would keep trying to find signal and flash the screen, ignoring all of my input.  Enraging way to spend $680 and hours of free time. So I sent it back and ordered an Acer with a dedicated source button.

"1515","Cons:• Incompatible with Apple computers.  -Technically it works, but it won't give you the native 2560 x 1140 (WQHD) resolution you're looking for. When plugged into an Apple computer (via HDMI or DisplayPort), the monitor will give you what looks like standard definition (even though it says it's at the native 2560 x 1440 resolution). The only way to get a ""higher"" resolution is to use Apple's scaling settings. But for professional graphics, you probably don't want a scaled image. So it's not really a replacement for a Thunderbolt display. It may work fine with PCs, but Apple has decided to make their products nearly unusable with others' products. I have a late 2013 MBP. The Apple techs tried to tell me the issue was that the HDMI cable can't transfer information at the same rate as their Thunderbolt cables, which is a complete lie. Perhaps they've limited the data transfer rate on the MBP's HDMI port, but HDMI cables (good ones) can transfer up to 45 GBPS (at present), which is more than twice the 20 GBPS rate of Thunderbolt cables.• Out of the box colour calibration not great. It's OK, but not really at a professional level, which is what I'd expect in a ""Professional Graphics Monitor""• Design/appearance is a little clunky. Definitely functional and not the ugliest thing out there, but not exactly a work of art either.Pros:• Fantastic adjustability. Viewing angles are great and the vertical adjustment ensures that you can work all day without straining your eyes or neck.• Price was great too ($469.99 USD when I bought).Bottom Line:This is probably a great monitor if you have a PC. If you're a professional working with a Mac, don't get this. The monitor is good, but Apple restricts their devices' connectivity. Terribly and needlessly frustrating.",11,13,2,24,54.1666666666667,45.8333333333333

"1519","I bought this monitor to hook up to my gaming/3d design laptop since the tiny 17"" widescreen laptop was straining my eyes. It was GREAT! Setup took all of 10 minutes (most of that was unpacking). I noticed no dead pixels or strange bleeding of any kind on this unit. I do 3D modeling and work with photoshop so the higher resolution was desirable but not enough to warrant the price. Being able to make the monitor taller, tilt it, and even completely rotate it was GREAT. I have had monitors in the past that were height adjustable but this monitor had most of the adjustments that I could want. I ended up returning this unit due to the poor quality and positioning of the speakers in the monitor. If removing the speakers would lower the price on the monitor then I would say do it! The speakers threw sound directly out the back of the monitor, AWAY from the listener, making it useless to try to use that feature even at the highest volume. Please note that I WAS NOT using it for music or looking for quality surround sound in games either, I know the limits of a two speaker system included in a monitor. I simply used it to watch a video that produced only voice speakers and I was unable to hear the people speaking. This is a bit unacceptable. I would rather pay less for a unit that had no speakers at all. I have gone through a lot of monitors in my time and despite the speaker issue I almost convinced myself to keep this monitor. In the end I felt the price for the ""features"" they included wasn't justifiable. I will wait for one without extra features that I don't need and/or are inadequate.Pros:- Resolution was wonderful- Adjustable height, tilt, and complete rotation- Great viewing angles- Easy to get set up- Fast response in games- Zero noticable glare- Everything the average user needs comes with it- HUGE!!Cons:- Horrible sound that could have been left off this unit",12,11,-1,23,47.8260869565217,52.1739130434783

The color accuracy and clarity of the panel is embarrassing for ASUS and whoever else uses the panel.Color accuracy was not good at all and everything was washed out. I even used a Spyder calibration tool/software with it. While it made the monitor look better than it did out of the box, it was in no way comparable to a good IPS monitor (such as ASUS' PB278Q), 4K or not.I expected so much more from a 4K monitor in terms of clarity. It almost seemed as if ASUS tried to do some pixel magic to make the panel appear to be 4K. I am getting better clarity from the ASUS PB278Q, even though it's 2K.Also, the monitor isn't VESA compliant and the displayport cable they ship with it isn't either. 99% of the time, the monitor refused to wake from sleep. I know this isn't the fault of my computer as I tried with multiple machines which still yield the same results.While over HDMI however, it does wake from sleep. But, who wants to run 4K over HDMI when it's 30Hz? Not this guy.All around, ASUS has a lot of work to do with this monitor.

"1586","This review is a combo of the bad description of the item I received from Warehouse Deals, and the bad customer service of Asus.This monitor was good in theory, bad in practice. I purchased it from Warehouse Deals, with the  ""Condition  Used - Very Good  Item is in original packaging, but packaging has damage. Cosmetic damage (Less than 5% ) on the top of the item."" description. This however does not describe what I received. First the shipping box had noticeable dents and deformations, not really Amazons fault, but the box used was also too big for the box the monitor was in, so it could shift around inside. Next the box that actually contained the monitor was not original packaging but a generic brown box with no brand labels at all. Inside the box was a big bubble sleeve thing that everything was in, but that offered almost no actual securing of the product in place, everything could move easily. Upon opening this sleeve I discovered the base/stand and power cables that had been included were just loosely put inside the sleeve with the monitor. The monitor itself was just covered in a plastic bag to prevent direct screen contact.I was first a little bothered by the lack of cables, it only came with a power cable and was supposed to include one of each video cable as well. Next the base/stand didn't look anything like the product pictures, and came with three small mounting screws. Once I actually looked at the parts I discovered they were indeed not the base and stand designed for the monitor at all. So now I was left with the screen itself, at least this worked. I was able to power on the screen with the power cord and plugged it in to my PC to test it, didn't have any dead pixels and lighting seemed fine. There were some finger prints on the screen before I even took it out the plastic bag it was in but they were removable.I contacted Amazon support to see if I could get a replacement since clearly I couldn't use a monitor without a stand, but since it was a Warehouse Deal item they couldn't issue replacements. They gave me the option to 1: return it for a refund and get free 1 day shipping on a new order. 2: keep it as is and get a 25% refund, 3: just return it for a full refund. I'm fine with that, Amazon did what they could.So I reached out to Asus support to see if they could offer some replacement parts and I could just take option 2 from Amazon. First I chatted with a representative who told me to contact Amazon for a replacement, when I told him I had and they couldn't he told me to email another support to ask for replacements. I asked for confirmation that they would have the stand/base and he said they would. Well I submitted a technical ticket, and two emails to different support emails. And in reply I got two emails basically saying the same thing, I needed to go to outside vendors for replacement parts. Even though the monitor I received is less than a year old and under all warranties they won't send replacement parts. The second email was even from the same CS rep I chatted with before telling me I had to contact Amazon again. . .So I decided to dumb the headache and go with option 1 from Amazon, I picked up another monitor of slightly lesser size and resolution and had free 1 day shipping put on that order.In conclusion I wish Warehouse Deals had not listed it as this condition when it clearly wasn't, I wish Asus CS had stood by their own words, but I will thank Amazon CS for being decent and trying to right the situation. 2 stars because the monitor seemed nice, but everything about it was horrible.",14,24,10,38,63.1578947368421,36.8421052631579

It's a crazy design and the fact that it doesn't work at all on my particular monitor (left and down don't work at all and there is no workaround) shows why the design is flawed.I'm surprised ASUS was this stupid to ruin an otherwise good monitor design with this insane idea for a tiny rocker button which is essential to all monitor settings.I would suggest to ASUS (which used to be my favorite brand) that they look at how BenQ has designed their monitor buttons and menu to be simple, clear, and working.Sending this monstrously heavy monitor back since it is has one tiny broken button will cost me a bundle of money. My mistake to buy ASUS. Never again.

"1641","I was not impressed with the 'amazing' colors that were supposed to be there because of the PLS panel on this monitor. My $120 ASUS monitor that was next to it had better colors than this one did. That is after extensive color calibration (on this monitor, not the cheap one.)On top of that, the monitor that I had received was defective. It had very very hard color distortion on the right half of the screen every once in a while. I conducted that it was definitively this monitor because it had the distortion even when there was no input plugged in.Many games and programs did not have the proper scaling, and UI elements were just simply too small. Yes, I had slightly gotten used to its added sharpness, and yes, going back to a 1080p panel seemed a little big, blocky, and blurry. That did not help my decision in going back to high refresh rate 1080p for everyday use. Everything that we know and love today is just about setup with 1080p in mind. At this very point in time, I would go for a really nice 1080p panel rather than a really budget 1440p, 1600p, or 4k panel at this time. I am glad to have my 144hz 1080p panel back as my main display.",6,10,4,16,62.5,37.5

"1701","I have owned this monitor for 10 months now and I've grown to dislike photography because of it.  Every day I am working in Photoshop and color accuracy is very important to me.  When I first got this monitor I used my Spyder2 calibrator to adjust this monitor, but that tool did not give me good results so I decided to order the Spyder4pro.  Same results with that calibrator, dull colors and it looked like the screen was covered in honey.  so my next step was to order the X-Rite i1Display Pro.  And the results were the same, dull colors, very little contrast and an extreme warm color cast.  I have been used to color calibrators warming up the screens a bit, but not too the point of looking brown.So my next step was going to TFT Central and using their color profile and monitor settings (quick note, why does Asus respond to reviews suggesting that users go to Tftcentral, why don't they just have something on their own page), but since I am not using the same system video card, the colors were off again.  I have basically reverted back to the stock settings of the monitor so I can at least get some work done.  But I know that when I visit my graphic artists friends at their workplaces, I look at my photos and I can see how the color is off.  this also happens when I order prints and receive them.I think one of the main problems is the brightness of this monitor.  it does start to look better if I set the brightness to about 70, but this is so bright that I start getting a headache within a few minutes.  I would say that it is the equivalent to staring at a 60 watt bulb from 2 feet away.  If I turn the brightness up all the way I can actually light my office pretty well.So, in order to avoid headaches and to save my vision I have to turn the monitor down to 30% and I am stuck with dull, lifeless colors.And what is my next step?  I guess I could save up my money and spend $1200 for a X-Rite i1Basic Pro 2.  That might be a little more accurate than the tools I have used but it is also expensive and since this monitor was supposed to be color calibrated before leaving the factory, I don't feel that spending $1200 to correct it is silly.  I could also live with the problem which would mean never having faith in my work and basically dread working on my photos.  or I can just save up for a new monitor.  saving up for a new monitor is the best option I think, but I know I might run into the same problem since many manufacturers are using the same panels (this one uses a Samsung LTM270DL02).  I might have to find one that uses an LG panel like the Apple products use.other than that I have had no issues with dead pixels or backlight bleed.  I do have to add however that the on screen controls are awful.  I've never used the built-in speakers so I don't know how they sound.",18,14,-4,32,43.75,56.25

Didnt receive anything else for FREE,like other people are stating free headset or something.The Design is ok, nice I suppose, can tilt up, can slide monitor too up and down, and whole base turns right or left, theres a round plastic plate under it. Its kind of stiff though, turning.  Dont know why people want to TILT A MONITOR UPWARDS! never seen anyone do that. I would like a DOWNwards much better and useful.  Actually it does tilt downwards hah(about 1-2 inch), not much but better than nothing.MY monitor is almost PERFECT screen. Bleeds white light at the bottom of the middle of screen,only noticeable if I hunch  down really low. Wasnt sure if I should return or get another or if its bad.Everything else is ok, as in clarity.All in all, I really wanted to display 1440p on all my computers :( .  Sucks only works with high end gpus[this is wrong, works with my 60$ 5570HD + 460ferm].For it to work correctly, need to use DUAL link cable. Old dvi cable wont work, bad reception. MyHDMI cable seems capable of 1440p, been using that, since its slim line.Edit: cleaned up review somewhat of a mess  :) .Its a nice monitor overall.  The new 4k monitors/tv are tempting though.",20,34,14,54,62.962962962963,37.037037037037
"1708","It is sitting in my warehouse unused. To get really WQHD you need to use HDMI input. I have tried to use Apple Dual Link DVI adapter using both 2014 Imac and MacPro Retina without luck. It would recognize the signalbut no picture. I was very dissapointed by the 1080 res quality as compared to my 27 inch Imac.  I have read various solutions in the reviews which were quite helpful but I do not have time to experiment and need a product that works out of the box as advertised. Therefore I do not give it just one star but two. Perhaps for some this might be a right monitor.",1,4,3,5,80,20

On 4k you can only achieve 30 hertz unless you use the display port, even on that you can only get 60 hertz refresh rates. The refresh rates blow and is depressing when it comes to the price. Movies and photos are gorgeous, games are beautiful but i would prefer a powerful refresh rate such as anything over 75 hertz.",3,9,6,12,75,25
"1716","The unsealed box was a portent of disappointing things to come. After unboxing the monitor from said (unsealed!) box, and having a look at the monitor, I immediately noticed white scuffs on the monitor surface (like peeling paint) *and* a big spiderweb crack.So, not 10 minutes after having received the thing, I've re-boxed it, arranged for a replacement, and slapped the return label on it. I'm willing to blame this on FedEx, until the replacement comes. Then we'll see.In the meantime: one star, and a resounding ""boo!"" to everyone involved (ASUS, Amazon, FedEx) for overall lameness.",3,4,1,7,57.1428571428571,42.8571428571429

"1719","I ordered this as an Amazon Warehouse deal because of the high price for only 27"". The reason I selected this monitor was because of its supposed higher resolution for graphic production. However, a warning to Mac Mini users... you probably will not be able to get more than 1080p. HDMI will only get you to HD resolution. You are supposed to be able to get a higher res via the Thunderbolt port and a DVI. This means ordering more cables and you still won't get the highest res available on the monitor.Now, about the ASUS: For this price, I expected a quality product, but was disappointed with the cheap feel of the body. The controls are difficult to use as they are under the bottom of the bezel and spaced far enough apart that you will need to use 2 hands to navigate through adjustments and settings. Calibrating a monitor with this set up is frustrating. The audio from the monitor is awful. Not that you would expect much, but the sound quality is so bad you want to turn it off. You can purchase a great HD tv for less than this cost and get better sound as well as picture and a remote to navigate the settings.Yes. This was a used item, but describe as ""like new"". That was not accurate. The scratches on the back of the monitor were pretty significant and elsewhere too. Not a problem for me because I just need the monitor to work well. It didn't. Only a couple of days after I received this product it quit working. I spent a lot of time mounting it on the wall above my desk and getting the right cables, calibrating and getting it set to my needs. Then it just wouldn't power on.Bottom Line: This monitor may be right for you and your computer. However, even though my Mac Mini has 2 graphics cards, video ram and 8GB of RAM I could not get the higher resolution advertised. The ViewSonic 27"" monitor is about half the price of this Asus, looks great and seems like a more substantial product.",9,15,6,24,62.5,37.5
